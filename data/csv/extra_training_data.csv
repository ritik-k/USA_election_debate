"Ah thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you Fayetteville and North Carolina thank you very much. Tomorrow we are going to win this state and we are going to win four more years in our great white house. With your vote we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our fantastic military, care for our Veterans, protect your second amendment, defend religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase ""Made in the USA"". Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country.",Donald Trump
Under my leadership our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded; 33.1%. Just announced last week. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. It's a number that we never even thought possible. Nobody did. Nobody thought it was possible and now we're going to do better than that.,Donald Trump
It's going very rapidly. While foreign nations are in a free fall; you see what's going on with so many nations in Europe unfortunately. I say that with sadness. We are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent data poll found the 56% of Americans found they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden.,Donald Trump
"You gotta remember that, you gotta remember that kind of thing. They didn't do a good job. In fact if they did I wouldn't have run. If they did I wouldn't be here right now. They did a bad job and Obama, he went out yesterday with Biden. They got like 14 people. They didn't have to many. They didn't have to good a crowd and we have five of these today, five.",Donald Trump
"We have some big ones. Thank you. Thank you, Thank you very much, thank you, thank you very much. Thank you and I love you too, and I appreciate that. We appreciate it. I was, I was thinking coming in because I watch these state polls, every one. No matter, if we're up by 10, if we know we're going to win easily ""he's down by one point, he's down by one"". Uh, I just watched this fake stuff and I'm saying to myself ""You know, we've been under a phonie, fake, hoax investigation for three years."" Nothing but bad and really corrupt publicity from these people.",Donald Trump
"And I say ""I wonder what the difference would have been if it had been legit"" and it turned out to be just the opposite. They were the ones that committed the crimes, not us . But I wonder what it would've been? It probably would've been a little bit easier but you know the good news, we're going to win anyway.",Donald Trump
"We're going to shove it, we're going to win anyway. I wonder what it would've been. I wonder what it would've been if all of the nonsense wasn't brought up. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Looking tremendous in Florida so of course they don't mention that. You know, Florida the, we are looking good.",Donald Trump
"We're really looking good all over in the real polls not the Fox polls. Those Fox polls, somebody at Fox doesn't like me very much I can tell you. They are the phoniest [Inaudible]. They were, they were almost as bad four years ago. Actually they were worse but you get some of these pollsters, they work magic and the amazing thing is that they hang on to their jobs.",Donald Trump
"They do horribly, look at what they did last week. I had nine states, I had to win em' all and they said I was going to lose all nine. Four years ago, I was going to lose all nine it was going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump. And the polls said decisively I was gonna lose all nine. And that was a day before.",Donald Trump
"And I won all nine. I wo -- No, I won 'em all. Or I wouldn't be here right now. No, I won all nine. It said, we're gonna lose all nine, and it was quite depressing as I turned on the television. Let's see how we did. ""He won Florida. He won South Caroli-"" You know what I'm saying? What to do with this? No, but thank you.",Donald Trump
"And then they said they're getting rid of the guy, like at Fox, I heard they were getting rid of that pollster, and they kept him. And they have others they kept. And you wonder what kind of business that is. You wonder what kind. We have a case where, in Wisconsin I have -- We're one up. And I left there a couple of days ago.",Donald Trump
"We had a rally you wouldn't believe it. Packed, just packed. Just like last night, like here. But, like last night, this was the section, you know, I wanted to come. This is considered a small, beautiful, cute, little wonderful section, and they asked me and I said, ""I wanna be there."" No, and every vote counts.",Donald Trump
"It's very important. We had something last night in Miami you would not have believed it. I don't know who saw it on television. I don't know. But you, you s -- you look at some of these, uh, results, like Wisconsin, so, you know, whether I'm up one or down one, it's right in that thing. I think we're gonna win Wisconsin because we have a lot of people that say, uh, ""We don't wanna talk to you,"" and then they go vote for Trump, right?",Donald Trump
"You know? The hidden voter or whatever they call them. Somebody said they're the shy voters. My people are not shy. They're not shy. But in Wisconsin, so they said, ABC News, which is, in my opinion, corrupt, but they're all corrupt, ABC News/Washington Post, which is basically a, uh, a lobbyist, as far as I'm concerned, for Amazon.",Donald Trump
"It's just a lobbyist. So, they didn't say like, ""He's two down, three down, four down,"" a fake poll. They said, ""Trump is 17 points down in Wisconsin."" Now, the real number -- I mean, I could lose it, I could win it. I think it's -- You know, how I'm not. I did a lot of good things for Wisconsin. But, you know, let's say it's even, and I call up a great pollster, John.",Donald Trump
"I say, ""John, let me ask you a question. I think we're one up in Wisconsin, but ABC/Washington Post -- "" They did the same thing four years ago if you remember, th -- very close to the election. They said we're down 12, and then we won, right? But we were down 12. And it's disheartening. It's called suppression.",Donald Trump
"What it does is it suppresses people. They say, ""Well listen, we love the president, but if he can't win -- ""So ABC -- But they did it four years ago and we complained bitterly with a very good lawyer. I had very good lawyers in those days. We complained very bitterly, and they changed it right before the election.",Donald Trump
"I think it was one, right? We were down one. They took it from 12 to one and it like -- about 15 seconds. And I realized, I said, ""This is a phony business."" But now they come down and it says, 17 down in Wisconsin, 17. So I call John, John McLaughlin. He's, he's like the dean. He's a great guy and he's been very good with me.",Donald Trump
"I mean, he said we were gonna win four years ago. He said i -- He said we're gonna win easily this one. He's a -- He's probably the biggest and the best. I said, ""John, let me ask you a question. ABC/Washington Post came out with a poll. It said I was 17 down. I'm not 17 down. I might be one down or I might be two up, but I'm not 17 down.",Donald Trump
"What's going on? Why don't they make it at least -- ""Because they have to live after that, they have to do other events and other -- Why don't they make it three or four or two or five or something, right? He said, ""They can't do that 'cause they want you to lose, and if you're two or three or four, everyone's gonna go vote.",Donald Trump
"They wanna make sure that your people don't vote. And when you're 17 down, people say, 'I just can't waste my time. I'm not gonna stand in line.'"" And I said, ""Isn't that sick?"" And he said he knows some of the people and they're very smart, they're very brilliant, they're smart people. He said, ""But if they made it five down or four down or six down, even -- So they make it something that's so bad, 17 down."" I said, ""Isn't that a shame?",Donald Trump
"I wanna tell that story. Do you mind?"" He said, ""I don't care. That's the way it is."" So it's crooked stuff. The Fox polls are horrible. Every time I have a Fox poll it's horrible. I mean, I like some of the things on Fox, certainly Sean and Laura, and Tucker's been great lately. And Fox and Friends in the morning is great, right?",Donald Trump
"We go through 'em. We have, we have some -- I find Harris to be great, Harris Faulkner to be really good. She's been very good over a period of time. Uh, the great Lou Dobbs, he's been fantastic, right? Brian. Jeanine, how do you like Jeanine, right? And, you know, look we have some, uh, we have some great people that support us.",Donald Trump
"Jesse has been great. Pete Hegseth has been great. And I don't wanna mention -- You know, there are a lot of people. Look, we have a lot, but it's 90 percent negative everything. You know, everything. It's not -- But so think of that. So I said, 17, and he gave me an answer. I just thought it was so incredible.",Donald Trump
"I said, ""I gotta tell that answer."" So, I hope I haven't bored you, but I thought it was interesting. Well? You good? I thought it was interesting. To me, it was interesting. And, and you know, I have like, uh, five of these to do today, so let's get going. I appreciate you being here. We had some, we had some monsters last night.",Donald Trump
"We had some, a little rough weather. It wasn't like this. We had, uh, in Michigan, we had a (laughs) slightly cold day, with the wind blowing at 40 miles an hour, in my face. And, you're lucky you have a President that doesn't need a teleprompter. I was able to -- Good memory. I would've been in big trouble.",Donald Trump
"There was no way you could hold paper. There was no way you could do, you were just -- And my guys set it up where the wind was right smack in my face. And I was looking at that flag from the play, and I said, ""Oh, no. Here we go again."" But actually, the flag must be a very high quality silk, because it's not that windy.",Donald Trump
"But yesterday, it was not, that was not an easy day. We had some very cold stops. If Biden and Harris, Kamala, Kamala. You want her? You want her as your first woman President? I don't think so. And the radical left gained power. they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a depression. Biden will raise your taxes four trillion dollars, massively increase your regulations, close down your factories, send your jobs overseas.",Donald Trump
"That's what he's been doing all his life, him and his group. Destroy the suburbs, dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private health insurance. 180 million people have great health insurance. Shred your Second Amendment, confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies.",Donald Trump
"Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and ban fracking. He said it for a year and a half, he said it. Then all of a sudden, he goes to Pennsylvania, ""No. I never said that."" And the fake news doesn't do anything about it. Biden's energy ban will send every state into crushing poverty, from North Carolina to Michigan to Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump
"As long as I'm President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas [Inaudible]. And we will remain energy independent. Sleepy Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of.",Donald Trump
"He was a cheerleader for NAFTA. And they're all coming home. Don't worry about it. I said it. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. North Carolina lost 50 percent of all manufacturing jobs after those Biden betrayals. And now he says, ""Oh, I'm gonna -- "" He's trying to follow my policy.",Donald Trump
"He's trying to follow my policy. He's not gonna do my policy. He's been doing this for 47 years plus, and for eight years a Vice President, which was only three and a half years ago. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who raked in millions from China, while giving them your jobs. [Audience chants ""Lock him up""] He's a corrupt, he's a corrupt politician.",Donald Trump
"You see it. Now they say the laptop Schiff. Watermelon head Schiff. ""That laptop was produced by Russia."" Here we go again. Russia. Russia, Russia. Here we go again. (laughs) Can you imagine what they must think of it? They're like, ""These people are crazy."" No. It was, it was produced by where's Hunter.",Donald Trump
"That's right. It was produced by them. These guys are really -- Think of it. No, Schiff knows. He's a, you know, psycho in many ways, but he knows. It's a total con game. I had to put up with it for three years. And it affects it. You know, when you see nothing but negative television every night, every night, every night, and then they find totally no collusion, after wasting 48 million dollars, 18 people.",Donald Trump
"Think of it. And then, it's no collusion, but then you have to run. But you've had three years of horrible publicity, and they did it, I mean, they did it. They were the criminals. Hilary was a criminal. She deleted her emails. People go to jail for that. [Audience chants ""Lock him up""] These are criminals.",Donald Trump
"These are criminals, and say it any way you want to [Inaudible]. But we took the brunt, then we caught them spying on my campaign and trying to overthrow a duly elected President of the United States. So I go -- And that was before I even knew. I mean, that was while I was, while I was running. I didn't even know.",Donald Trump
"I'd hear these things, sir, uh, this is before I got elected. Guys would come up to me every once in a while, ""Sir, do you have anything to do with Russia?"" I said, ""No, why do you ask?"" ""Oh, I was just curious."" Because it was like this thing floating around. And then they come up again, ""Sir, are you sure you don't have anything to do with Russia?"" I said, ""I have nothing to do with Russia.",Donald Trump
"What the hell are you talking about?"" And you know, you hear it four or five times, then you get into office and they come up with this scheme and this, this plot. It was a plot to overthrow the government of the United States. And then we have people that just don't act fast, I mean, it's just unbelievable.",Donald Trump
"We have so much -- We have so much information. We have so much -- We have the whole thing. And Obama was involved. And Biden was involved. [Audience chants ""Lock them up""] They were involved, but it's, let's see what happens. People should move more quickly. In 2016, North Caroline voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as President, who is finally putting America first.",Donald Trump
"And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. If I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than any President has ever fought for his people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.",Donald Trump
"Get out and vote, that's all I ask. Just take a little time and vote. Vote. We got to win this state. I think we win this state, we win Pennsylvania -- We're going to win Florida. We win Pennsylvania, and you -- We're going to win the whole thing. We're going to win the whole thing. And we'll send them a signal like they've never seen before.",Donald Trump
"This has not happened to them. ""Big tech is so powerful, you can't beat big tech,"" they're saying to us. And I see it on Twitter, trending, trending, trending, right? It's not trending. They put the most boring thing. Only it was, anything bad about me, number one in the world on trend, right? Boring stuff.",Donald Trump
"I mean like, stuff -- Uh. As opposed to affairs, scandals, they don't even put that stuff up. It's always drop two, three, four, five items. It's a fix. It's a fix. This is a smart guy. We have his name, everybody knows who he is. And I'm not talking about the primary, I'm talking about people that work.",Donald Trump
"They take stuff out of a hat, let's see, this is bad about Trump, let's make it worse. Okay, we'll make it worse. Okay. Number one trend in the whole world, no, that's not stuff that trends, but these are phony guys, they fix the elections, and you know what? They should be subject to campaign violations because it's -- They're a [Crosstalk] they're an arm of the democratic national committee, and they work together.",Donald Trump
"They work on messaging together. The democrats, the fake news media, they're the worst. The fake, the fake people. And if I've done one thing, it's to expose the dishonesty in the media. And not everybody, but a big vast majority, a vast majority. Not everybody. Look at us, we catch Hunter and Joe cheating.",Donald Trump
"We catch them stealing millions of dollars. They refuse to write a story. Could you imagine if I got three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Could you imagine, somebody gave me three and a half million bucks? Somebody gave me $20 -- They impeached me because I made a perfect phone call to the head of Ukraine.",Donald Trump
"I never met the gentleman. Congratulations on your win. If you see anything corrupt, please call the Attorney General of the United States. And we have a corruption agreement with them because it's been a very corrupt country. I actually have an obligation. Now of course, they impeached before they found out, before I decided to release the phone call.",Donald Trump
"Isn't it lucky that I had that call transcribed? Can you imagine? No. Can you imagine? Now, they couldn't do it. They didn't know what to do. Crazy Nancy said, ""This isn't impeachable."" She said, ""You're right."" They said, ""You're right, but let's go through with it anyway. Maybe we'll get lucky."" Can -- No.",Donald Trump
"This is -- Because, she didn't know about the call. When she read the call, she said, ""He didn't do anything wrong. How did you get me into this, you shifty Schiff? How did you do it?"" Jerry Nadler. I've been fighting this guys for 25 years on the East side of Manhattan, the West side of Manhattan. Jerry Nadler.",Donald Trump
"He's a beauty, isn't he? ""How did you get me into this? Well, let's just keep going forward."" It's a disgrace. And we won. I will say this for the Republicans. 197 or 6, 197 to nothing, we won. And in the Senate, 52 and a half to one half. We lost a half of one. I wonder who that could've been. But, Sleepy Joe Biden is bought and paid for by China.",Donald Trump
"He's got, hey, they gave the son a billion and a half dollars to manage. That means he's gonna make millions of dollars a year. He doesn't know anything about investment. Didn't know anything at all about energy. He got $183,000 a month on energy. Think of that. Think of that. $183,000. I called a friend of mine on Wall Street. ""Is this a normal thing?"" He said, ""No, maybe the most abnormal thing I've ever seen in my whole life.",Donald Trump
"I've been doing this for 25 years."" He's the biggest guy. But, they're bought and paid for. They got the money. And then, they were going for the big one in China. They wrote a letter to a very big, powerful man within the Communist party. And, whereas Hunter asked for ten million dollars a year, as he was gonna recommend.",Donald Trump
"He was going to talk. You're gonna see, here's a guy that didn't have a job, got thrown out of the Navy. He got thrown out of the Navy. He didn't have a job. Biden becomes Vice President, and this kid is like a vacuum cleaner, going all over the world, following his father, picking up the scraps. You know, he's following his dad, picking up scraps.",Donald Trump
"And then, you find the note where the big man gets ten percent. The big man's Joe Biden. Huh? The big man gets ten. Then in one case, they said 50 percent. Right? That's more likely, because he wouldn't do it for ten. He'd want, because these people are all hangers on, losers. But, uh, that's the story, and it's in a laptop.",Donald Trump
"And now they say, ""The laptop was made by Russia, therefore it has no credibility."" Can you -- No, no. Can you believe this though, right? And so, the news, there's not, outside of the New York Post, which really, I hold in high esteem, they have done, they're like a hero paper. And they endorsed me. I got a nice endorsement from -- Did you see it from Pennsylvania yesterday?",Donald Trump
"Right? Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Gazette. That was nice. Once I got through that first paragraph, it was phenomenal, actually. They said, ""We don't love his personality. We don't love his tough demeanor."" But, I have to be tough. Look, I've been under investigation from before I ever became President. I have to be tough.",Donald Trump
"If I was soft, I wouldn't be here right now. And, they don't wanna say that. I was under a fake investigation by a lotta fake people, Bob Mueller and his crew. The whole thing was a fake scam that should've never been started, and they knew the answer on the first day, but it took them two and a half years to put it down.",Donald Trump
"No collusion. But, they knew the answer the first day. So, I was under investigation for the first two and a half years. Right? Think of that. And then they say, ""He's tough."" But, I'll take it anyway. I'll take your (laughs) endorsement anyway, because once you get over the first paragraph or two, it says all of the things we've done, which are incredible, which are incredible.",Donald Trump
"And now, we'll have a chance to do it, uh, without the cloud, because I had a cloud hanging over my head, whether we like it or not. And then they say, ""He was tough. He fought too hard. He was somewhat crude. He was very, very nasty. His Twitter -- "" Now, you know what? If I didn't have social media, I wouldn't be here.",Donald Trump
"It was the only way I could defend myself. So, it's one of those things. But, I just wonder. I was thinking. I asked the people on the way up -- We have great people, such loyal, great people, including a man that comes from an area not too far from here. He's a good friend of these women who've been here, this is number 64 times for these incredible, beautiful women I think rich women and their husbands are in here someplace.",Donald Trump
"But -- but they had their husbands, they were at the one last night. That was a big deal, wasn't it? But, uh, this is number 64 I would say, right? 65 (laughs) oh, there's two more. They come from North Carolina, but we have, Mark Meadows comes from North Carolina. And he has been fantastic, he's done a great job, he's done a great job.",Donald Trump
"Where is he? He's probably working, you know, bum, bum, bum with the phone. He's got two phones instead of one. And he's not gonna break it up with a hammer like Hillary did. He's gonna -- It's gonna throw it away. He'll come down, watch. He's done a fantastic job, and he is, and he loves this state, he loves North Carolina.",Donald Trump
"And I specifically said I want somebody from North Carolina, give me Meadows. Now I knew three years ago, I said, ""We gotta get Meadows in here."" Big tech, big media, big donors, and powerful special interest, are desperate for Sleepy Joe to win, they want him to win. I'll tell you who wants him to win, China.",Donald Trump
"They will own our country, because they own him, they control him, and they know he will always be there to do their bidding, he'll always be there, he's a corrupt, he's a corrupt politician. I don't care, I'll say -- And I say it, everybody knows it's true. Can you imagine? Big tech refuses to put anything in, they took the New York Post down for two weeks because they didn't, they won't let anyone write.",Donald Trump
"If you put out a little tweet and say that Biden is corrupt, they will knock out your whole account. Nobody's ever seen anything like this. And do you notice? It is, outside of what I say, it is indeed faded away. Because you can't have a scandal if nobody writes about it. So we have the fake news not writing about it, and you have the big tech not writing -- So, so how can you have a scandal?",Donald Trump
"Nobody's talking about it. Nobody's allowed to talk. It's called, suppression. We don't have freedom of the press. We don't have -- Probably haven't had it for a long time, but we don't have -- You know, they say, ""Freedom of the press, the American way."" We don't have -- We have suppression by the press.",Donald Trump
"That's what it is. What beautiful words. I should've done this speech this way, it would've been much more interesting than what I'm -- No, but seriously, we have suppression by the press. This is not freedom, this is the an -- the, it really is. It's the exact opposite of freedom of the press, you know, if you think about it.",Donald Trump
"Every corrupt force in American life, that is responsible for cruel betrayals that hurt our family, and, you know, all of the people that we love, they're supported by Biden and they're donated by it. You know, I could've been a much bigger fundraiser than him, but I didn't wanna call every head of a Wall Street firm, every head of the oil companies that we've made rich anyway.",Donald Trump
"I did a great job. We're energy independent, that's not so bad, first time. The failed establishment that started the disasters far and worse, they support Sleepy Joe Biden, 'cause they get anything they want. And he took in $300 million last month. You think he made any deals? No, I don't think so. The career politicians that off-shored your industries, and decimated your factories, they support Sleepy Joe.",Donald Trump
"The open boarders lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs, gangs, and crimes, the people that wanted to stop the wall even though it knew it works. It's almost finished, by the way. Will be finished [Inaudible]. But the people that wanted to stop, and even they, though they knew full well it worked.",Donald Trump
"Remember they said, ""No, no, we don't wanna wall, walls are obsolete. We want drones."" Drones? Okay, good. Drones flying to watch the people pour into our country. They want drones. Let's have drones. The Far Left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police, and demeaned your sacred faith and values, they support Sleepy Joe Biden.",Donald Trump
"You an't even go to your churches, you can't even go to your church. And your governor of North Carolina, you gotta open up your state. You gotta get your governor, I hope you're gonna vote for Dan, who's, who's good. But you gotta get your state open. Don't worry about it, by November 4th they'll announce your state is opening.",Donald Trump
"On November 4th, uh, North Carolina will be opened on November 4th. The anti -- Right after the election, the anti [Inaudible] 'cause they want us to look bad, they don't care about people, they want us to look bad, they wanna try and steal an election. The Anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, our heritage, our heroes, they support sleepy Joe.",Donald Trump
"Antifa and the rioters and looters and Marxist's and left wing extremists, they all support Joe Biden. They always like to blame it on the right, did you ever notice? These were right wing, and uh, it's very rare, it's ver -- you got bad on every side. But, they always like to blame the right. It always starts off with the right, the right.",Donald Trump
"This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the arrogant, corrupt, ruthless and selfless political class? Or do you want to be governed by the American people themselves? Do you want to be represented by a career politician who hates you, or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before?",Donald Trump
"I didn't need this job, I had a very nice life, but -- I love what we're doing for our country. Nobody's done so much. Nobody, no administration -- and, you know, I never even had a challenge on this from the fake news. You know, normally, if you say something slightly off they make a big deal. No administration, president, has done more, in the first three and a half years than we have.",Donald Trump
"Our military we rebuilt, our tax cut, our regulation cuts. Space Force, just a thing like Space Force. I never even talked about Space Force, right, during the campaign. I did more than I actually talked about during the campaign. Thank you, thank you very much. [Audience chants ""We love Trump""] Thank you.",Donald Trump
"Thank you. Thank you [Inaudible]. I thought this was a small, little, cute area. You know, this was a small, little, cute area. When I came in I'm watching FOX and a gentleman and anchor said, ""They have a small crowd of about 2,000, 2,500."" M -- I knew, I knew, you know, it's, it's an incredible thing, this is a lot more than that.",Donald Trump
"This is a lot of people, this is a lot more than we, I wanted to be here, because it's an important [Inaudible]. I mean my granddaughter is named, Carolina, d -- you know that? And we'll give South Carolina some credit too. You know, they've been with us, is that okay? I wanna get your permission. No, we'll give South Carolina -- South Carolina's great, they're great people too.",Donald Trump
"A vote for Biden is a vote to hand the keys to government over to people who despise you and who want to rob your children of their American dream. That's what they're doing. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists, communists, socialists, the wealthy liberal hypocrites who want to silence, censor, cancel and punish you. [Audience boos] If you want your children to be safe -- and remember this, th -- they were against the Sec -- I'll put it very simply, against the Second Amendment.",Donald Trump
"Right? If you're pro-life, you can forget about it, you know that, right? Tremendous support. We have, I'll tell you what, we have -- did you see these people in California? They have lines of hundreds of miles of cars and tractors and Iowa. And votes five or six thousand votes in lakes in ocean with the flags and -- If you want your values to be respected, if you want to be treated with honor and dignity and respect, then I am asking for you to go out tomorrow or sooner, but I don't know, you tend to like to vote on Election Day, right?",Donald Trump
"We all do. And vote, it's gonna be the most important election, in my opinion, in the history of our country. I never thought I was gonna say it. If you would have told me I was gonna say that four years ago I would have said, ""you're crazy."" But, uh, it's the most important, because, I've always said we will never be a socialist nation.",Donald Trump
"And that's what they're trying to accomplish. And re-, well, and remember what I said four years ago. I said, ""I am your voice and we will make America great again."" And that's what we're doing. And, and if we didn't get hit by the China plague. Now we're building it up again, and we're doing it at record clip, and record numbers, and at a much faster pace than any other country in the world, but we got hit by the plague from China, and we will never forget it.",Donald Trump
"With God as my witness I will never let you down. For the last four years the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me because they know I don't answer to them, I answer to you. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class, and we will drain the Washington swamp, and we will save the American Dream.",Donald Trump
"This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown. He wants to have you locked down. I don't even know if he knows, I mean to be honest. They ask him a question, I don't think he has a clue. You can vote whoever you want but I don't think he has a clue. You know it. The media knows it. The media laughs behind his back and then they say, ""He did brilliantly today."" No, he didn't do brilliantly, he can't do -- He didn't do brilliantly in his prime, and he's not in his prime anymore.",Donald Trump
"Or, a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic, and we're doing very well with the vaccines. They'll be distributed very soon. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state.",Donald Trump
"Looking again, that's more Kamala, you know. Remember when they said, ""This is the Harris-Biden administration,"" right? I never did that with Mike, and you know what Mike Pence never came to you and he said, ""Do you mind if I put my name first every once in a while?"" No, because -- And, by the way, he's been a great Vice President.",Donald Trump
"Some people say it was a perfect combination. It was. He's a great guy. He loves -- He's going to be in your state in a little while. Locking you in your home while letting far left righters roam free. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Easter, no Christmas, no Fourth of July, and no future for America's youth.",Donald Trump
"Other than that it's fine, I think it's just -- If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life then you go and cast your ballot for President Trump. And, if you remember the catastrophe -- Joe Biden, you know, he's telling us how to run things right? This guy never ran a thing successfully.",Donald Trump
"He said horrible things about him when he was in the administration. Obama didn't even want to endorse him. He wouldn't endorse him. Even after he won Obama said, ""This is, no way."" How long did it take him after he won? It took forever. Obama couldn't believe it. I don't think Obama's much better, you want to know the truth.",Donald Trump
"Joe Biden personally ran the swine flu, right, the swine flu, H1N1, which he can never remember. He never says it. He says it, he goes N1H1. I said, ""No."" He failed horribly and he was a laughingstock all over Washington. They were laughing at him, and his own Chief of Staff said he was absolutely terrible.",Donald Trump
"They had a terrible, they did a terrible job. Now he's telling us how to do it. I should have closed earlier. There's only one problem, he's on record all over the place knocking me two and a half months later for closing too soon, and closing at all. He said, ""Don't close."" He's xenophobic. You know, he's xenophobic.",Donald Trump
"I didn't like people from China is what he's saying. It's so wrong. I think they are incredible people. I do, I think they're incredible people, but they were, he said, xenophobic, and then he runs for office. He says, ""He should have closed earlier,"" and you know what the press never covers that. They just, you can't get -- The only time I get it covered is of I happen to be on live television I'll say it again, and again, and when I do say it they try and turn it off.",Donald Trump
"Let's go to a commercial break right now. I think I know what's coming. These are really bad people. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, said that Biden has been wrong on every, actually on nearly every, major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. He had no respect for him whatsoever.",Donald Trump
"Sure he endorsed him because he's probably looking for something like everybody else, but I don't think any of them are going to get anything, because I think we're going to have one of the greatest victories tomorrow. But, you don't have to take my word for what a disaster Joe Biden is, because it's the great state of North Carolina.",Donald Trump
"I spent a fortune. See this? See the board? I spent a lot of money on the board. So let's just take a look at, uh, a little roll. Let's roll it, please. [Video Begins]",Donald Trump
"Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it to yourselves. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] Our country has such potential. You can't do that to our country.",Donald Trump
"He's not mentally equipped. But, uh, he just doesn't -- to be your president. He's not equipped to be your president. And I say it, you know, I say it because he's not a nice person, never was a nice person. But he was never a smart person. He was a touchy feely person, you know? Hail and hearty, but not nice.",Donald Trump
"But this is not a man that 25 years ago was not equipped to be your president. And he ran many times, numerous times. We called him 1% Joe. Think of it. And now he's working on about 50%, and he ends up winning the nomination because of Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren gave him the nom. All she had to do is drop out and he would have lost to her on Super -- I mean, then we would have had Crazy Bernie, so you know, what the hell.",Donald Trump
"But at least Bernie, you know, they had a great energetic base. It's a small base, but energetic. But, uh, this is not a man that should be your president. We have tremendous potential. Our country has tremendous potential. And we can't blow it. We can't blow it. Because there's no way to describe that. And, and that's like 1%. We could keep you out here all day.",Donald Trump
"Much of it happened yesterday and the day before yesterday. Oh, we had some beauties yesterday. But we can't do this and you know what's going to happen. Kamala will be put in that position very quickly. Very quickly. And she's more liberal than Crazy Bernie. She's more liberal. In fact, she makes him look like a strict conservative.",Donald Trump
"Joining us today are some incredible people, incredible friends and warriors, and I want to tell you. I just looked at a poll and he's up in the poll. Senator Thom Tillis. He's up. He's up. That's great, Thom. Good. I'm very happy with that. That's -- we've got to get him in. He's a good man. Good man and your wife was great the other night.",Donald Trump
"We had a -- Oh, good. We had a great rally the other night and you were well represented, let me tell you. Very well. Congratulations. Well, let's save that for tomorrow or the next day. Or, as the Supreme Court would say, ""Sometime into the future."" What a ruling. What a ruling. What a horrible thing that they've done.",Donald Trump
"Do you know that puts our country in danger? Do you know what can happen during that long period of time, Pennsylvania? The long period of time? Do you know what can happen? Number one, cheating can happen like you've never seen. This is their dream and, uh, they are s-, they are known for it, you know? The Philadelphia area is known for it.",Donald Trump
"But what can happen during that long period of time is just as, a disgrace. Get your ballots in and have them in long before the third and have them counted before the third and have an election where we can say to the world that we know who won and we know who lost. What a horrible -- Our Supreme Court, I'm just, I'm just so tired of some of these horrible political decisions that are being made.",Donald Trump
"It's a shame. It's a shame, and, uh, you know, I won't get into it too much, but I'm going to start getting into it because they're hurting our country very badly. Very badly. Representative, warrior, David Rouzer, Rouzer, David, David Rouzer. David, thank you. You're doing a great job. Appreciate it. Uh, Congress, we have a friend over there, David.",Donald Trump
"Richard Hudson. Where is Richard? Richard? Richard Hudson, Congressman. Another great guy. Great guy. He's done a fantastic job and a friend of mine and somebody that's done an incredible job also in Congress, Dan Bishop. Thanks, Dan. Thank you, Dan. Doing a good job. He came in, you know, he came in through the, the system.",Donald Trump
"He won a race that was a tough race, right? We worked together on it and he had no choke in him. He started off a little behind, to put it nicely, and he ended up winning and he won solid. And how are you doing on this one, good? I don't have to help you as much. Ah? He's gonna win. He's gonna win. He should win.",Donald Trump
"He's a great Congressman. All of them, all three. Thank you very much, fellas. A man that hopefully you're gonna recognize for, I guess he doesn't have the funds that the other one has. He has, you know, I see commercials all the time for your governor that has you in a total lockdown. But Dan Forrest would be a phenomenal governor.",Donald Trump
"A phenomenal governor. He would be -- and you could have a surprise, Dan. That could be a big, beautiful gift to North Carolina. It would be a gift. That's not bad. Hey, Dan, that's not bad, huh? Beautiful. That's -- Hey, Dan, that's a very impressive, uh, applause you got. I have to be honest. Don't kid yourself.",Donald Trump
"That is like a poll, you know? It's like a poll except that instead of interviewing 73 people, they have thousands of people here. Much more than the 2,000. Well, h -- h -- he's got a, uh, nice 2,000 people and I don't think so. But last night in Miami -- you, you want to see a crowd? You couldn't even see the end of it.",Donald Trump
"I've never seen anything like it. There's such spirit. I've never seen spirit like this. And North Carolina GOP Chair, somebody doing an incredible job, if we win tomorrow. By the way, if we don't win tomorrow, they'll say, ""How's Michael Watley doing?"" And I'll say, ""Not good at all. He didn't do a good job."" Michael Watley, are we doing okay, Michael?",Donald Trump
"Yes? Get out. Get out the vote, Mike. Get 'em out. Get out the vote. Thanks, Michael. And you are doing a good job. I also want to recognize medal of honor recipient command sergeant major Bob Patterson. Where's Bob? Where's Bob? Where is Bob? Wow. He looks good. He looks good. Your husband, wow. That's a good looking couple.",Donald Trump
"Wow. That's some, uh, incredible honor. That's some incredible honor, I tell you what. There is no greater honor, and uh, are you proud of your husband? I bet he's proud of you too. Oh, oh, she's proud of Trump. Look at that. Thank you. I knew I liked her. I knew I liked her. Thank you both very much. Great honor.",Donald Trump
"That's the highest honor you can get. Former prisoner of war and Vietnam veteran captain Ken Wells, a real, a real hero. Where is Ken? A real hero. Thank you. Thank you. (laughs) Real tough one. Look at him, he's tough. He's a tough looking -- he's a tough looking guy. Thank you, thank you very much. Beautiful.",Donald Trump
"You look great. Thank you. These are great people. And World War II hero and D-day veteran very, very brave they say, Harold Frank. Hi Harold. Looking good. Thank you Harold. Thank you Harold. Thank you. They said he's a brave one. Thank you Harold. You're looking good. Oh, these guys look good. I don't know.",Donald Trump
"They go through all that, they come out, they look better than all of us. I don't know. Something about the war. Something about brave people, right? Military spouse and don't ever underestimate, that is where it all begins. Somebody who's incredible. Donna Dotson. Donna? Where's Donna? Thank you Donna. Thank you very much.",Donald Trump
"Thank you Donna. Great to have you. Thank you very much. And retired sergeant major Karen De la Vega. Karen, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Karen. They're great people. Thank you all for your extraordinary service, and it's an honor to have you with us. It really is. Thank you very much. For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously, repeatedly attacked black Americans.",Donald Trump
"He decimated the black middle class, and called young black men ""super predators."" To every black American, vote for Trump. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to insult you, to jail you, and to betray you. I am fighting for you and got criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, and funding for historically black colleges and universities.",Donald Trump
"I got it done. Nobody else got it done. And with the exception of, and I use the word possibly, possible exception, but I could use it. Maybe I won't. I'll keep it a little bit less controversial. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln, there has been no president that's done more for the black community than Donald Trump.",Donald Trump
"No president. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. Joe Biden has pledged to open boarders. He's actually talking about taking down the wall, can you believe it? ""Let's take down the wall. Let everybody pour into our country."" He wants to take down -- no, he said it.",Donald Trump
"I don't now. I, I -- maybe. But he did say, ""Let's take down the wall."" One of the biggest projects that we've ever done, you know, it's a tremendous project. We're up to over 400 miles. we're gonna be finished very soon. Over 400 miles. Exactly d-designed to the specifications of the boarder patrol who are great.",Donald Trump
"Mass amnesty wants to gve them free healthcare. This is for illegal aliens and wants to keep deadly sanctuary cities -- . [Audience boos] You state has a sanctuary city. You know that, right? You have a sanctuary city right? [Audience boos] A very big one, actually, that doesn't work very well. We believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans not criminal aliens.",Donald Trump
"The Biden/Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorists nations by a staggering 700%. This has been agreed to. [Audience boos] This has been agreed to. No thank you, fellas. I'm not interested. I'm keeping radical, Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country if I have [Crosstalk]. If I have the approval of North Carolina, I will [Crosstalk]. We're going to keep them out.",Donald Trump
"We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We have the greatest equipment, greatest people. $2.5 trillion, you think that was easy to get from the Democrats? Actually, the wall was even tougher. The wall was tough, but we got it. Did you notice once I got the wall started, got all the funding, won all the court cases against the Democrats, the press never talks about it anymore.",Donald Trump
"They don't talk about it. We had the best statistics, the best, and can you imagine, during the pandemic, there's, you know, Mexico's very heavily, unfortunately, infected. And it was a good thing that we had it up. That's why the numbers are so good. We also passed for our great vets, VA Choice and VA Accountability.",Donald Trump
"Nobody thought that could happen. We obliterated 100% of the Isis caliphate. We killed the leader of Isis. Al-Baghdadi is dead. Last week, I visited Fort Brag, where I presented the Presidential Unit Citation to the special forces team that achieved that historic victory. It was good. And we are keeping the name Fort Brag, you do know that, right? [Crosstalk]. They want cancel culture, you know?",Donald Trump
"We won two World Wars out of Fort Brag and we have other forts. We're keeping it. We won two World Wars out of Fort Brag, and now they say, ""Let's change the name."" ""Let's change the name of Fort Brag. We'll pick somebody else. Uh, do you have any good suggestions?"" No, no. We have to, we have to keep, we have to keep.",Donald Trump
"It's our culture. It's our heritage. So many victories, so many victories out of Fort Brag. We also eliminated the world's top terrorist. Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they tried to get it.",Donald Trump
"And instead of endless war in the Middle East, we're forging peace. They are lined up to come and [Inaudible]. I said, ""How did Obama and all of those that came before him, do it?"" They told me, ""They all used the same method."" And I said, ""Really? I'm going to go the opposite method."" And it worked very nicely.",Donald Trump
"No, no blood in the sand. No cost. Three very powerful countries already signed. We have many others. They're standing in line. Standing in line, and we're bringing our troops back home. Our troops are coming back home. They're coming back home. 19 years is enough. They serve as policemen. I said, ""No, you have to get your own police department."" [Crosstalk]. A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream.",Donald Trump
"And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China, which is already started. Can you imagine, Biden saying we're not going to, we're not going to end our reliance. I mean, can you imagine? We are going to end out reliance on you.",Donald Trump
"Hey, hey, we gave you seven billion and a half. What the hell are you telling me? Okay, well. I don't know. Senator, I think it would be tough for him, right? No, he wanted, they wanted 10 million, they wanted 10 million a year for his services, right? And then you say, ""No."" I'm not gonna deal with China anymore, or I'm gonna be tough on China.",Donald Trump
"You know, I've taken out many, many billions of dollars. We never did this in this country, not 10 cents. I gave 28 billion dollars from China to our farmers, because they targeted our farmers. 20 -- 28 billion, and we have plenty of money left over, which went into the US treasury, thank you. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults for law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary sinners.",Donald Trump
"With God's help we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. You know, with the envy of every country the world, our military now has the greatest equipment, all made in the USA, but we have the greatest equipment in the world.",Donald Trump
"We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and lower drug prices even more. We instituted a favored nation's laws. We pay by far the most in the world. We are going to pay now the least in the world, and nobody can believe I did it. And big pharma does not like me too much. They are not so happy with me.",Donald Trump
"And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.",Donald Trump
"And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. I do. And your tobacco growers are in good shape, please let them know, okay?",Donald Trump
"You have any tobacco growers here please? They're in good shape. They work hard. They were treated very rough. Tomorrow you have the power to do so much for our country. You have the power to vote, so go out and vote, unless you're gonna vote for somebody other than me, in which case, sit it out. Don't worry.",Donald Trump
"You have these politicians get up and they say, ""You have the power to vote, and it makes no difference if you vote for me or my opponent."" They're such liars. They're such liars. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get your boss. Grab him by the tie, say, ""Let's go boss."" And get out and vote.",Donald Trump
"From Greensboro to Charlotte, from Wilmington to Raleigh, from Asheville to right here in Fayetteville. Fayetteville, I love the name. Fayetteville. We inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great, great beautiful skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come.",Donald Trump
"You will see that. Proud citizens like you help build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. We are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.",Donald Trump
"We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America powerful again, military. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, North Carolina, thank you. Go out and vote.",Donald Trump
"Oh, thank you. Ah, wow. This is a big crowd. We have a lot of big crowds, but this is a big crowd. This is great. Thank you very much. Hello, Traverse City. Hello, Michigan. We want the same result as we had four years ago, from Michigan, right? And we fulfilled all our promises. You have auto plants, so many, you have -- You didn't have one in 42 years, and now you have 17, and going up, and they're going so fast, I don't know.",Donald Trump
"Nobody's complaining, I can tell you that. But, uh, we want that same result. We're gonna get out and vote, because tomorrow we are going to win the state. And we are going to win four more years in the White House. And I want to thank you to our great Vice President, Mike Pence. He works so hard. I will take him over Kamala every day of the week.",Donald Trump
"I will take -- We will take Mike, he's great. He's great. He'd done a great job. He works very hard. And he had a good debate. Didn't he have a good debate against Kamala? From a different world. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect our second amendment, defend religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful term, ""Made in the USA."" Right?",Donald Trump
"Made in the USA. Next year -- [Audience chants ""USA""] -- will be the greatest -- economic year in the history of our country. You know, you had a great year last year, the year before, the yes before, three great years. The best you've ever had and, you're gonna have the best year you ever had next year.",Donald Trump
"We're all set. You saw what happened, under my leadership. Our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever. Ever, ever -- recorded. 33.1% you saw that on Friday. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. That's a record, while foreign nations are in a free fall. Sadly in a free fall, you look at what's happening with Europe and other places, very sad.",Donald Trump
"We are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. You look at our numbers, look at the auto numbers, look at what's happening with that business. And, uh, so many other businesses in this country, but that business because we happened to be in a place that likes automobiles. Right?",Donald Trump
"A recent Gallup Poll just came out. Found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago, under Obama and Biden. And that's during a pandemic, and we're rounding the corner. We're rounding the corner. And you gotta open your states. You gotta open your state. Open it, open it up, Governor.",Donald Trump
"Open it up, Governor. Right? Open it up, Governor. You gotta open it up. If Biden and Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a very steep depression. [Audience boos] They want to raise taxes at a level that nobody's ever heard of before. Biden will raise your taxes over four trillion dollars.",Donald Trump
"Ma -- It's not him. Did, do you think it's him? He doesn't have a clue. He has no clue. But that's okay, let's assume he does. We have to win, and so that's that. Can't do that to our country. Our country has too much unbelievable potential, actually. Massively increasing your regulations, shutting down your economy.",Donald Trump
"They're gonna close down your factories, send your jobs overseas to China, and other places. I don't think so. Destroy the suburbs. Are you happy in the suburbs that I ended the regulation that was going to destroy the suburbs? And has been destroyed, the suburbs. The woman of the suburbs, they love me, I think, but, you know, the fake news says they don't. But I think they do.",Donald Trump
"They love their home. They love their house. They don't want a development put next to their house. They want their house the way it is. They want to have their beautiful house, and they want to have security, and they want to have safety. I think they like Trump. I really do. That happened the last time.",Donald Trump
"That happened four years ago. Remember? They said, ""Women will not vote for Donald Trump,"" at that time. ""Women will not."" And then at the end of the evening, where they were all crying, they say, ""Women, what happened?"" The women came out, right? The women, the women liked us. That's nice. Well, I like the women, I will tell you.",Donald Trump
"I think the women are great. You notice? We don't even talk about the men with suburbia. We let you guys be alone. They want to dissolve your borders. Maybe rip down the wall. They were talking about that, ""Let's take down the wall."" [Audience boos] You know, we have our strongest border right now. And the wall is almost complete.",Donald Trump
"Mexico is paying for the wall, by the way, but -- It's almost complete. Terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare. 180 million people, they want to take it away, go to socialized medicine. I don't think so. [Audience boos] You've worked for hard for that. You have some of the greatest healthcare in the world.",Donald Trump
"You've worked hard for it. They want to take it away. 180 million private plans. Take it away. Now, if you feel a little bad or if you want a checkup, you go to a hospital. You wait in line for about six weeks, and you get yourself checked out. If they say you have a problem, they can't do anything about it.",Donald Trump
"That's called socialized medicine. Confiscate your guns. Second amendment. [Audience boos] And indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. [Audience boos] And just a little while ago, on the beautiful Air Force One -- How does it look? Let me see. Oh, you don't see it. By the way, how 'bout the sky?",Donald Trump
"Wow. It's so beautiful. Let's just look at the sky for a little while. I wish we had time, right? I wish we had time. So, uh -- You know, I've made uh -- We'll do five today. Five of these, all with love. All with big crowds. All with love. Probably. Somebody said I actually do six today, because we finished up last night in Miami, at 1:30 in the morning, so -- [Audience chants ""We love you""] Thank you.",Donald Trump
"Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. That's very nice. Thank you. Don't make me cry. Don't make me cry. You know, if I started to cry, they'd have a big story. They'd say, ""The President broke down and cried."" And I don't know if that's good for us. Probably, it could -- Maybe it brings me up four or five points.",Donald Trump
"I promise. Huh? I don't care. But that's really nice. You know, it's never been said before. They say that's never been -- We've liked Ronald Reagan. We've like a lot. But they say that's -- The love, we love you. Think of it. When you think about it. Right? No, it's, it's an incredible, it's an incredible thing.",Donald Trump
"We've worked hard. We've gotten you everything we said. We've done the things we said. We've done the things we said. We got you the biggest tax cut in history, the biggest regulation cut in history. We've rebuilt our military. Our vets just gave us a 91% approval rating, on what we've done for them. We've got you Space Force, and you'll be making a lot of the stuff, right here in Michigan.",Donald Trump
"Face -- Space Force is the first -- That is the first time, in 74 years, since Air Force. Think of that. Right? A whole new force. I just signed an executive order, on Air Force One, to teach our students pro-American values. It's a good thing. With all the things that I've been watching, that have been taking place over a pretty long period of time, a pretty long period of time, even before Obama and Sleepy Joe.",Donald Trump
"Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and to ban fracking. Look, he said it. He said it. [Audience boos] He campaigned, for over a year, ""We will ban fracking. We will ban fracking. We will ban fracking."" Then he goes to Pennsylvania and they said, ""Well, you know."" His people told him.",Donald Trump
"He didn't have any idea what they meant, but it was okay. He listens to 'em. They said, ""Listen, you have to be in favor of fracking now."" He said, ""Okay. No problem. Why?"" I always said it about 200 times during debates. Right? So they've been -- So now he goes into Pennsylvania, where we just left. Great people, by the way.",Donald Trump
"You talk about -- That was a, an unbelievably enthusiastic group of people. We're going to win Pennsylvania. We're going to win. We're going to win Michigan, too. We're going to win. We're going to win Pennsylvania. We won Pennsylvania last time, too. We won this one, we won -- This one hadn't been won for many, many years, and Pennsylvania the same thing.",Donald Trump
"It wouldn't -- But then Trump came along We won them both. We beat crooked Hillary, crooked Hillary. Now we have a guy that makes Hillary look like a baby. No, we had some -- We've had a good time. And until the Chinese, until the China plague came along, everything was good. We closed it down, we saved two million lives.",Donald Trump
"Now we're opening it up. We had the greatest economy we've ever had. See the hat? All the make America great again, now we're having it make America great again, again. You know? And our country was coming together. You know, the other side was calling. Everybody was successful. Best numbers for unemployment, African-American, Hispanic American.",Donald Trump
"And, by the way, do you see what's going on in Florida? African-American, the numbers are phenomenal. Hispanic American, the numbers are beyond belief. They got problems. You notice they haven't been talking too much about Florida for the last, uh, six or seven hours? They're not liking what they see. They're not -- Wow, that is a lot of people.",Donald Trump
"Look, you can't even see. Why don't you take the cameras down there? You can't even see the end. I hope you can hear us down there. It's like two football fields away. I hope you can hear us. That's great. Wow, that's really good. But, uh, no, Florida's looking great. You're looking great. Came out two or three up.",Donald Trump
"I don't why two or three up. You know, am I supposed to be happy with three up over this guy? I tell you. But, you know what? Let's just put the win in the column. We won't even talk about it. But you're looking great. North Carolina, great. Um, Iowa came out, the big poll came out yesterday. You saw it.",Donald Trump
"And we were a lot up. Big, big up. Well, the farmer's like me, you know? I got, for the farmers, 28 billion dollars I got, 28 billion from China. Thank you very much, China. Thank you. Because they targeted the farmers. They targeted the farmers, and I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, ""Sonny, how much?"" He said, ""Well, two years ago, it was 12. And last year it was 16 billion."" 16 billion, 12 billion.",Donald Trump
"A total of 28 billion. And I tariffed China. We took the 28 billion. We had a lot of money left over, into the treasury, and we gave it to the farmers, and the farmers are not complaining. I tell you, they're in business. They would have been out of business. Biden's energy ban will send every state into crushing poverty [Inaudible]. And you know this, you know what they're doing, from Michigan to Wisconsin to Arizona, where we're leading very nicely, thank you, and to Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump
"As long as I'm president, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth. And we will remain energy independent. We're energy independent for the first time, first time. That means we don't have to call people up in far away places and say, ""We need some oil, please. We'll send our armies over there to protect you and help you."" But we do have great allies over there.",Donald Trump
"We'll help them. And we've certainly helped Israel, but we have a lot of good people over there. We'll help them. But we don't need their oil. It's nice not to need -- We have more oil than they do now. You know, we have actually more oil than they do. We're the largest in the world. Isn't that a nice feeling?",Donald Trump
"Sleepy Joe -- And that would not have happened, except for what we've done over the last three and-a-half years. There's never been an administration, or president, there's never been an administration that has done, in the first three and-a-half years what we've done. Never. And not even close. With all the things we've done.",Donald Trump
"And the fake news never even questions it. I've been saying it for a long time. They don't even question it because they can't. Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless, ridiculous foreign wars. Countries you've never even heard of.",Donald Trump
"A vote for Biden is a vote to extinguish and eradicate your state's auto industry. You don't like that, do you? I don't think so. You know, he was going to do the PPP, he was going to do different things that would've been so bad for you. I ended it, I ended it all. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which was the worst trade deal ever made, probably by any country, that sent all your auto jobs -- You know, they have 32% of our auto jobs, right?",Donald Trump
"And, uh, It's probably the number one reason I ran for president. And, in fact, I was in Michigan. I don't know if anybody remembers this, 12 years ago they gave me the Man of the Year. You remember? And I had a big, I made a speech and I said, ""Why are you letting,"" uh, you know, it's not my business,"" but I said, ""Why are you letting them steal your auto jobs?",Donald Trump
"They're all going down to Mexico."" And by the way, plenty go to Canada, too, right? People don't know that. And it was a terrible thing that took place, but we've stopped that and now the USMCA makes it very, very financially difficult for them to do that. It was very important to me. And everybody said, ""We'll never be able to do it.",Donald Trump
"We'll never be able to end NAFTA."" And you know what? Because it was so good for Canada and so good for Mexico, and they have a lot of power, but we ended it and, uh, they're not that happy but they're happy enough and we have a great deal, and we have, uh, people. I'll tell you, Mexico, we've had a great relationship with Mexico.",Donald Trump
"Canada's a little difficult to deal with, to be honest with you. You know, O Canada. We all love O Canada, right? I love that. They stand for their national anthem and we have to stand too because, you know, you know, you saw the ratings on the NBA down 71% for their championship. You know why? Because people don't want to hear it.",Donald Trump
"They don't want to hear it. They want to see a basketball game. Obviously, not too much, but I didn't watch it and a lot of people didn't watch it. And the NFL has to be very careful. They tried that game two years ago and I thought we taught them a lesson, and they have to be very careful. We have to respect our flag, we have to respect our anthem, and we have to respect our country. [Audience chants ""USA""] Sleepy Joe supported China's entry into the WTO.",Donald Trump
"Michigan lost half of all auto manufacturing jobs after those Biden betrayals. He also supported the Transpacific Partnership, which would have been the death sentence for the U.S. auto industry. I canceled TPP, I ended the NAFTA disaster, and I took the toughest action ever taken against China. We never took in 10 cents on China.",Donald Trump
"I've taken in billions and billions of dollars over the last two years. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. They don't want to write about it. They don't want to write about it. They're not allowed to write about it. Their bosses, whoever their bosses may be, they're not allowed to write about it. Who sold out Michigan to China, he sold you out.",Donald Trump
"That's one of the reasons, when they send over a car they charge us 35% tax, we charge them nothing. But those days are changed. We changed it. We changed it. And it's going to change a lot more if you give us another four years, that I can tell you. We were just beginning. We were just beginning, and not only with China, with everyone else who takes advantage of our country. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] Thank you very much.",Donald Trump
"No, but with everybody else it takes a -- It's not only China, it's everybody. We renegotiated the South Korea deal. You know that. That was a deal, crooked Hillary made that deal. It was going to give 250,000 jobs. She was talking, ""This will produce 250,000 jobs."" They signed it and she ended up being correct, but the 250,000 jobs all went to South Korea, not to us.",Donald Trump
"That was standard. That was standard. Biden is the living embodiment of the decrepit and depraved political class that got rich bleeding America dry. And you know what happened. Look, there haven't been too many states that have been effected like you've been effected. You got seriously effected. [Audience chants ""Drain the swamp""] That's what we're doing.",Donald Trump
"We're doing it. But when I ran, you never told me it was going to be that deep, that vicious, that rotten. It's a deep sucker. I thought we'd knock it out fast. We went through three and a half years of hell and here we are, and they're not too happy and they're, they're reeling. They're reeling. They're going to be knocked off very soon.",Donald Trump
"They're going to be all knocked off very soon. Now we've, we've done a good job but it was, it wasn't easy. You get impeached over a telephone call that was perfect, perfect call. Perfect call. Congratulations on your victory Ukraine president, Ukraine. Nice man. Never met him before congratulations. ""Sir, could you call up and congratulate the president of Ukraine?"" ""Sure.",Donald Trump
"What happens?"" ""Oh, he just won."" ""Okay, good."" So I give him a call. I avoided it for a long time because it was a lot, you know, busy. Call up and they say, ""Let's impeach him."" I'll tell you. And we had great support from the Republican Party. I have to say that. 197 to nothing in the House. 52.5 to 0.5. You know how the half was?",Donald Trump
"That's all right. We had 52.5 to 0.5. Mitt Romney. [Audience boos] He still doesn't know why. He say, ""Let's see, why did I do that?"" Uh, he, he wished he didn't do it. I'll tell you that. In 2016 Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who finally put America first.",Donald Trump
"And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician it's because I'm not a politician. Probably wouldn't be here if I was. And if I don't always play by the rules of Washington, or the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you, and I fight harder and harder and harder. And better than anyone's ever fought for you.",Donald Trump
"We, we were brought here, we were put here to fight for you. I had a very easy life before this, I have to tell you. [Audience chants ""Thank you Trump""] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I had a very easy life, I had a different kind of a life. And you know what? I wouldn't have changed that decision when I said, ""First Lady, let's do it.",Donald Trump
"You're gonna be First Lady."" She was actually one of the people. She said, ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" First Lady. People love the First Lady, they do. They love her. She's great. She's elegant. And she puts up with a lot from these people, you know? It's like, unbelievable. [Audience boos] But she said uh, ""But are you sure you want to do this?"" And I say, ""I think I do.",Donald Trump
"Yeah. I think I do."" She said, ""You know you will win if you do it. You must be sure."" And I said, ""You think so?"" I said, ""You think so really?"" And she said, ""No, you will win definitely. But the question is, do you want to do it?"" I said, ""Yeah, we do. We have to set this nation back on the right course."" I'm sorry.",Donald Trump
"No. She said that. And I'll never forget that. I always thought it was cool. You know? You know you're, it's like, second nature. You know you're wed, you know, for good, running against a lot of very talented people. And then we had to run against a very talented, crooked machine. Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media, and powerful special interests. [Audience boos] You saw that over the last couple of weeks. [Audience boos] All the corruption, and they refuse to even talk about it.",Donald Trump
"Could you imagine if I got 3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Or one of my kids took 3.5 million from -- Can you imagine that? And they refuse to even discuss it. They don't want to discuss it. There is no proof. They now say the laptop from hell was produced by Russia. This was Schiff. Watermelon Head, right? ""The laptop, uh, was produced by Russia."" And we say, ""Oh, oh, not again."" No, John Ratcliffe came out immediately.",Donald Trump
"He's great. He's doing a great job. He said, ""It was not produced by Russia."" So, but that's what they try and do. They do disinformation. They're the biggest disinformation group, I'll tell you. They own him, they control Biden, and they know he will always do whatever they want. They know that. That's why they want him.",Donald Trump
"I definitely don't do what they want. I definitely don't. Except I do one thing, I get them good ratings. Can you imagine if they don't have me? Let's say they had Biden. Their ratings will collapse, every one of them will be out of business. They'll be out of business so fast. Every corrupt [Inaudible], it won't be, it will be -- They will be out of business so fast.",Donald Trump
"In fact, I think they're gonna get together, The New York Times will die. The failing New York Times. Washington Post. Which is basically a lobbyist for Bezos. You know that. But they'll all get together and they'll say, ""Listen, we made a big mistake here. We got to draft Trump. We got to get him to run again.",Donald Trump
"This is no good."" ""We're dying, nobody cares."" Can you imagine that? Having Biden. We're gonna put something up. Can you imagine having Biden as your president? [Audience boos] The biggest loser will be the fake news media, they will, that will be so boring. You know their ratings are through the roof. Everything's through the roof.",Donald Trump
"The NFL is doing very badly. You know why? Everyone's watching politics, because they find politics to be much rougher than the NFL. Much dirtier, and more disgusting, and -- And they don't change. You know the NFL, they change the rules. They make everything like coming back, you can't touch anybody. Somebody tackles too hard.",Donald Trump
"They say, ""15 yard penalty and you're out of the game, and you're out for the season."" You know the old days, right? It was a little different, but it's still tough. But this is much tougher. And people see it. But you have to see the ratings. It's -- That's why the ratings are bad for a lot of the sports.",Donald Trump
"Nobody ever thought of this, but I thought of it. Couple of people wrote it. The ratings are bad because so many people are watching this. It's tougher. True. But they're going to be calling for us, ""Please, please run again. We think, uh, we are going to endorse you."" I got endorsed by the Pittsburgh -- Right?",Donald Trump
"Pittsburgh Post Gazette. I got endorsed, first time since 1972. Right? It's a big deal. Big [Inaudible] are very good. Very liberal newspaper, but that's okay. But first time since 1972 that they endorsed a Republican, so it's an honor. And if you don't read the first two or three paragraphs it was one of the best endorsements.",Donald Trump
"Yes, we don't like him. Yes, he has a horrible personality. But listen to this. It's not that they do, but I have been under siege, illegally, for three and a half years. I've been fighting for three and a half years. And I said to somebody today, I wonder what it would be like if the fake Russia hoax, and all this crap with the impeachment over nothing, over a phone call that was perfect.",Donald Trump
"That was perfect. I wonder what it would be like if we didn't have all of this horrible stuff. And, and if it didn't -- You know, we'd have a very calm, a calm situation. And maybe I'd be less popular. I don't know. Maybe I'd be less popular. Because you know what? The fact is, people see that we fight.",Donald Trump
"We're fighting for you. But it's just a really -- It's a really dirty, horrible business. But I said today, because they were very -- They would say, ""Jeez, they don't like the personality, and he's always fighting."" I'm fighting to survive. You have to survive. Very few people would have survived. They would have been in the corner.",Donald Trump
"They would have said, ""Mommy, Mommy,"" put their finger in their mouth, put their thumb in the mouth and say, ""Mommy, mommy, take me home. I'm out of here. Get me the hell out of here, Mommy."" They'd say, ""Forget about the American people, Mommy, I want out of here right now."" No, we can't do that. But we have to fight hard.",Donald Trump
"And then you fight hard, and you hit them back and then they say, ""There's chaos in the White House."" They caused the chaos. We have a great group of people. We have a lot of them here tonight. Great people in the White House. But it's true. I wonder why -- I wonder w -- if it would have been different.",Donald Trump
"You know, if they didn't -- Because these were all -- We caught them spying on our campaign. We caught them trying to take out a duly elected president of the United States. That's treason. That's treason. We caught them. And someday maybe something's going to be done about it, too, you know? Maybe. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.",Donald Trump
"They can't -- We don't want to do anything prior to the election. But what about me? They did it -- They did it to me before the -- They spied on my campaign before the election. ""We shouldn't do anything prior to the election."" And you know who we caught? Barack Hussein Obama, and sleepy Joe Biden. They were a part of it. [Audience boos] We ought to get these reports out.",Donald Trump
"They should get them out before the election, as far as I'm concerned. They should get them out right before the election. They should have gotten them out a long time ago. We have, we have information -- You wouldn't even believe it. I don't even get involved. I always said I'm going to stay uninvolved.",Donald Trump
"It's very hard for me to do, I'll tell you. No, it is, because you know, I didn't, I didn't have to do that. I thought it would be the right thing. And yet they did the Mueller report, right? The phony Mueller report. 18 angry Democrats, smart. 18 angry, vicious -- Many of them worked for Hillary Clinton. 18 angry Democrats.",Donald Trump
"They spent $48 million, and at the end of two and a half years, no collusion, okay? A friend of mine said, ""You have to be the most innocent man in the world. And they checked everything. They checked taxes, they checked -- For $48 million you check taxes, right? And by the way we announced, you know, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes.",Donald Trump
"They didn't say that. They refused to say. They say, ""Well, prepaying isn't paying."" I said, ""No, it's prepay, that's even worse."" Millions of dollars. Many millions of dollars. And that'll all come out. Every correct -- And you know when you look at it, when you look at what's ha -- gone on, seriously, think of that.",Donald Trump
"Just think about that tonight when you're with your family. I wonder if it would have been difficult, you know, different. I wonder if it would have been a different kind of a feel. And you know what? Honestly, maybe it wouldn't have been as good. Maybe we wouldn't have these massive crowds because you see what somebody is where we're under siege, and you people get it.",Donald Trump
"You're smarter than them. You're smarter than these people. You get it. And you've always, and you've always gotten it and it's a beautiful thing, and I'll never forget it. I want to tell you, I'm never going to forget it. But we were under siege and we caught them, and it's treason or whatever you want to call it, but with Sleepy Joe Biden, they don't want to write anything.",Donald Trump
"We caught the whole thing. The son, where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? The son was like a human vacuum cleaner. He'd go in and follow his father. ""Let's go to China today, son."" They fly in on Air Force Two, right? I guarantee you one thing, Mike Pence, I know his kids. They don't do that. They don't do that.",Donald Trump
"They're unbelievable kids. Military. But, you know, um, ""Let's go to China today, Dad."" I'd like to follow you. It's like, err. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars. Fees on -- Oh, he must be a great investor. You know the greatest investors don't make that deal with China. China doesn't do that.",Donald Trump
"They don't give money out for other people that are less smart than them to invest. Let's give our money to somebody that's not very smart to invest, okay? That's a great idea. He walked out. It only took him 10 minutes to get it, too. $1.5 billion, that's millions of dollars in fees. The big one was the 10 million.",Donald Trump
"You saw that one? The letter. He wants 10 million a year for introductory purposes. Okay, 10 million. But it all blew up. By that time, the laptop from hell was found. The one that Schiff said was developed in Russia. It's unbelievable. And then you have Ukraine. He goes into Ukraine. His father was in charge of Ukraine, right?",Donald Trump
"He was in charge of Russia, Ukraine, China, specifically. He goes into Ukraine. $183,000 a month. ""Do you have energy experience?"" It's an energy, right? Burisma. ""Do you have energy experience?"" ""No, I don't. I don't know anything about energy."" ""Well, we'll pay you $183,000 a month and we'll give you an upfront fee of approximately 3 million.",Donald Trump
"Would that be satisfactory?"" No, think of it. No, think of it. And that's -- and there are other things, too. Other con-- Then he's got the brother and he's got all -- This is a corrupt enterprise. And then they had -- the big man gets 10%. The big man. Who's the big -- He's not a big man to me. To me, he's a very meek, fragile -- He's a fragile person and he's very agitated.",Donald Trump
"I watched him today. He gets more -- He gets more time on Fox. I've never seen anybody on Fox so much. Him, they have everybody on Fox. They have all enemies on Fox. I can't -- I think it's crazy. But he gets a lot of time on Fox. But he, he's so agitated and now he comes out with the aviator glasses, but they're a little too small.",Donald Trump
"They should be -- He wants to look like Tom Cruise from a long time ago. No, but he's fragile. He's not gonna be there. That's not what they're counting on. They're counting on somebody else. They're counting on by far the most liberal person in the senate, Kamala. They like her. They like Kamala. Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you is supporting Joe Biden.",Donald Trump
"The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign Wars, they support Biden. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your auto plants, and you suffered for many, many years. I'm telling you, that's why I'm here, I think primarily. That was the first thing, trade. I said, ""How could they do that?"" They supported Biden.",Donald Trump
"The open borders lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs and gangs and crime that poured into our country, they support Biden. They still do. The anti-American radicals, defaming our noble history, heritage, and heroes. They support Biden. They support him. They support Sleepy Joe. And you know, I signed a law that you take down any of our statues, any of our monuments, you go to jail for 10 years.",Donald Trump
"It's amazing the way it seemed to have stopped, isn't it? It's really amazing. Somebody said, ""Oh, it's just stopped."" No, it didn't just stop. I took an old law and reactivated it because the new law and you go into this with this bunch, with Nancy Pelosi and Crying Chuck Schumer, you know what they'll do?",Donald Trump
"They'll give you a medal of your rip down the statues. Antifa and the rioters, looters, the Marxist, and left-wing extremists, they all support Joe Biden. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfish political class, or do you want to be governed by the American people, yourselves?",Donald Trump
"You know, the govern, the way we supposed to be. A vote for Biden a vote to give control of government over to the globalists and the communists, socialists and wealthy liberal hypocrites who want to silence, cancel and punish you. Cancel culture, they call it. Cancel culture. No, thank you. We want to be proud of our history.",Donald Trump
"Good, bad, whatever, we want our history. We want to know, and we want to learn from our history. We don't want our history canceled, we want to learn. There's things we have to learn from my history, too.

"I mean, for years it, it just automatic, killing each other for many, many decades. And we're doing these trade deals with them, not big deals, but they want them very badly, we're doing them. And they're each doing them. And I said to the people, I said, ""Listen, we're doing deals. They want to make the deal with us.",Donald Trump
"Everybody wants to make a deal with us."" I said, ""They're killing each other, I think, right? They're killing each other. I read about it. They're killing each other for decades. Tell them we're not making a deal, unless they get together and make a peace."" And we told that to them. ""We're not interested in doing deals, unless you guys could get along and not kill each other."" You know, it's human lives.",Donald Trump
"We don't know where it is. You don't know where it is. Some people have never heard of the places. But they're places and they're people, they're human beings. And I said, ""Tell them we're gonna do it, but you have to make peace."" And we got them together, we made peace. And they actually nominated me for Nobel Peace Prize.",Donald Trump
"I got four nominations in four unrelated things, that's crazy, right? And I told the story, you probably heard about it. The first one I went up, Middle East. You know, the Middle East is coming along. Got no blood in the sand. No, nothing. The Middle East is great. Signed already, three countries. We have seven, eight, nine countries, they could all sign.",Donald Trump
"I said, ""How did Obama do it?"" And they told me, I said, ""Good. We'll do it the opposite."" But not only Obama. For many, many years, they haven't been able to do it.

"We have countries lined up, no money and no blood in the sand. No blood in the sand. Remember what I said four years ago, ""I am your voice and I will make America great again.""

"We will drain the Washington swamp, and we will save the American dream for your children, for your grandchildren. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown or a safe vaccine. The vaccine is coming along great, couple of weeks, couple of weeks. It's gonna be out soon. That ends the pandemic.",Donald Trump
"And it will end, anyway. They hate it when I say we're rounding the corner, it's gonna end anyway. But the vaccine will make it go a lot quicker. And what we've done with therapeutics is incredible. B -- excuse me, here I am. But I like to say -- No. No. I like to say it had no impact on me. I didn't really need it, they just happened to give it to me.",Donald Trump
"Because I made perfect physical specimen, that's very young. I'm very young and in perfect physical shape. No, but, uh, it's amazing. What we've been able to do is incredible. Really incredible. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few weeks, and it will quickly eradicate this virus. We're gonna start off very much with a -- you know, we've learned about it with our senior citizens, especially if they have a condition, a heart condition, they have some problem, any kind of a problem.",Donald Trump
"Boy, it's, it's vicious. That's the ones it really goes after. But we're gonna protect our great senior citizens first, and then it'll go very quickly throughout, for anybody that wants it. Won't be enforce -- it's not gonna be enforced. For people that want it, and we'll get it done and it'll, it'll all take place.",Donald Trump
"And r -- very quickly, and by the way, nobody else would have been able to do what we did, you know, nobody else would have been able to do what we did. You know, Joe Biden, he handled the Swine flu as one of the great catastrophes. He was a, mess, his own, his own Chief of Staff said, ""We had no idea what the hell we were doing."" I don't know why this guy admitted that, I still -- I can't figure out why he admitted that, uh, probably before Joe thought he could have a run.",Donald Trump
"You know, Joe thought his career was over because he wasn't thinking straight. That he ran, that he ran and Elizabeth Warren said, ""I want to stay until the end and take out Bernie, you know, she took out Bernie. And we're running against Joe instead of Bernie and Bernie's gonna run again though in another four years.",Donald Trump
"He's gonna run again. He, one thing about that guy he never gives up, does he? But, he's, he's a hell of a loser. I mean, he loses the first time and he goes back and he's like, ""No hard feelings."" He loses the second time horribly, the way they took -- the Democrats took advantage of Bernie Sander's and everybody that he represents.",Donald Trump
"And th -- but they, they're looking to take over Joe. They signed, they, you know, they agreed to the manifesto, I call it. You have to see what's in that one. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state, that's what he wants. Locking you in your home -- [Audience boos] -- while letting the far left rioters, they could -- So the rioters, and the looters, the anarchists, Antifa, they could go knock the hell out of you, roam your streets, set your stores on fire.",Donald Trump
"No problem! That's called protesting. We must protect our protestors, but you're not allowed to go to church, you're not allowed to have dinner, right? The only one allowed to have dinner in this state is the husband of your governor. [Audience boos] He's the only one that's got special privileges. That was not a good day when he got caught boating, or whatever the hell he was doing. ""Who are you?"" ""I'm the husband of the governor."" The police didn't go for that one too well, did they?",Donald Trump
"Ha. No, that wasn't a great day. No, you gotta open up your state, Governor. Open it up, Governor. Let the kids go back to school. Let the kids go back to school. It's like Barron, Barron Trump, right? They said, you know, First Lady had it, I had it, they said, ""Sir, you tested positive. First Lady."" Then come to see us a little where, th -- they said, ""Sir, uh, Barron, he just"" -- White House doctor, great doctor, Sean. ""Sir, Barron just tested, uh, positive."" I said, ""Tested positive for what?"" For corona.",Donald Trump
"You know it sounds like -- see I like th -- the China Virus. Or I like the plague from China, but a lot of people use it like, it sounds like an island in Italy. I said, it's not corona. But, ""Just tested positive for corona"". I said, ""Well, I don't like that. That's not good."" Barron, he's, you know, he's, uh, strong, he's very tall.",Donald Trump
"He's only 14 years old and he's very tall, I get to, ""Hi, Barron."" And he's a good boy, but he just tested positive and I said, ""Well."" And then about 12 minutes later I see the doctor, uh, ""Doctor, how's Barron doing?"" ""Oh, it's okay, he's fine now."" It took him about 12 seconds to get rid of it. Because they're younger they have a strong immune system.",Donald Trump
"No, he was f -- I mean he got better, like in so fast. And, uh, you know what I say? Let the kids go to school. And you're not gonna hear that from the other side. They wanna lock it up. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easter, no Christmas, no Fourth of July, no future for the youth. [Audience boos] Other than that, it's gonna be a great life.",Donald Trump
"No, you gotta let the kids go to school. Get going, open up your state. It's time. And, you know, we gotta take care of our seniors, we have to take care of people, we understand it. We have to do things, but let the kids go back. This is a lockdown, this is as shutdown. Of course, probably, on a date like, November 4th, they'll announce, ""Well, we're gonna decide to open up"", right?",Donald Trump
"Did you see the one head of the union said, ""Yeah, we want the teachers to go back to work on November 4th."" That was not a good move. She announced. We want the teachers to go back on November 4th. Ch -- yeah, I wonder why that day? Despite that we had the best numbers. Look we have states that are locked down, closed down.",Donald Trump
"New York is having a hard time, I'll tell ya. They are, they are, they don't know what the hell they're doing. Great place. I left it three and a half years ago, I loved it. And, it's very sad what's happening to New York, a very, very sad thing. And Chicago, look at Chicago. It's very sad. All run by Democrats, by the way, I wanna just emphasize.",Donald Trump
"How 'bout Portland with the anarchists, right? With Antifa ana -- their Antifa anarchists. But, how about Portland? We could solve that problem in 25 minutes, like we did, you know, we went into Seattle, we were ready to go in, we were all set to go in. And we told them, we're going in tomorrow morning.",Donald Trump
"And the night before they said, ""Okay. Well we're leaving now."" That could've been done a long time ago if they asked us. We have to be asked. But -- And we did a great job in Minnesota. We're gonna win Minnesota for two reasons, we're going to win Minnesota. First time since 1972, we're gonna win Minnesota.",Donald Trump
"You know why? Number one is, Ilhan Omar. [Audience boos] The fact that she's there. No, but she loves our country very much, right? [Audience boos] She has a great deep and abiding love for our country. And the other one, boy the hate, the hatred is just crazy. How do we put up with this stuff, right? I mean, the hatred.",Donald Trump
"But, but she's the number one reason, and maybe number two is the fact that the National Guard did one hell of a job in Minneapolis. Now, they should've called us, they should've called a week and a half earlier, it would've been nice, you wouldn't have had the fires raging, right? The anchors that said, ""This is a friendly protest."" And behind the anchor the whole -- It looked like the world was burning down. ""This is a friendly protest."" See?",Donald Trump
"Because they don't report the truth. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, and misery. [Audience boos] You gotta just get out of this. We have to -- [Audience boos] We can't play games. Our country has such incredible potential. We can't let this happen. This country will never be a socialist nation, okay?",Donald Trump
"And that's what they want to do. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live the great, great life that you've always want to have, then go cast your ballot tomorrow for your all time favorite president, I hope. Donald Trump. [Audience chants ""Trump""] And remember that Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, a respected guy, he worked with Biden.",Donald Trump
"He said, ""Biden has been wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades."" Other than that he spoke very well of him. But you don't have to believe me, you don't have to even listen to me, because it happens to be Michigan. We spent a hell of a lot of money on that right there. So roll the tape. [Video Begins]",Donald Trump
"It's gonna be incredible. We can't let that happen, everybody knows it. And you know, if you were a nice guy -- he's never been a nice guy, he's never been a smart guy, never been smart, everyone knows it, never been smart. But if he was a nice guy, we wouldn't even do that, but that's just like a -- a very small version.",Donald Trump
"That's not even the bad stuff. And one thing I can tell you, President Chief China, Putin, Kim Jong-un, you guys are at the top of the cave. They can't have this. We don't wanna give them this. We'll lose our country. We'll lose our country and we can't do it, we can't do it. Biden would be a disaster for cherry growers, farmers, workers, all across your state you do so many different things.",Donald Trump
"Joining us tonight, a representative, Jack Bergman. Two great guys, Jack, thank you very much. And John Moolenaar. Thank you John, thank you fellas. Great warriors. They've been uh -- just incredible people, I'll tell you what. They've been with me through everything, right? And we appreciate it. Are you in good shape with your races?",Donald Trump
"You don't need any additional help? They're probably about 30 points up. You know when somebody's good, they're good. You guys are great. Thank you very much, both. And your next senator, a tremendous guy, I -- I spotted him a long time -- I spotted him, he was somebody I looked -- there were five people running a little while ago, year ago, for a seat frankly, you have somebody that -- that's okay.",Donald Trump
"But I saw this man, and I said ""roll it back, I wanna see that again. John James, right?"" And I said ""wow, what potential."" And then I found out West Point, great student, great helicopter pilot. I'd trust him 100% to pilot my helicopter, I would do that one hundred percent. No, he's supposed to be a great -- a great warrior, actually.",Donald Trump
"But I got him to run and he got his feet a little wet and then he uh -- he just took off, and I understand you're doing very well in that poll, John, I hear. Do you wanna come up here? Huh? Come on up. Come here, John. Come here. Come on over here, John. Come on over. He's a great guy and I hope he's going to be voted in. You're doing very well. Come on, John. [Inaudible].",Donald Trump
"Mr. President, it's an honor to have you back in our state. Are we grateful? Are we grateful for the United States?",Donald Trump
"We still that have a life that doesn't benefit all of us. We need to get leadership that's been tested in the real world, people who understand how to create jobs in the real world who can continue to bring results for everyone. So it's my honor, it's my honor as a war fighter and as a combat veteran to stand before you here today and encourage you to go vote because only you can drain the swamp.",Donald Trump
God bless you.,Donald Trump
"Fantastic, John. He's a good, good guy, great man. That's a big, that's a big very important vote you're casting in addition to our vote. John James, he's a star. He's going to be a star and you have somebody that's very special, And, uh, you know, his competition, nobody knows who the hell he is. Peters.",Donald Trump
"You know, you have a great state, Michigan. They say, ""Oh, who's the Senator?"" Peters. Peters. Who the hell is Peters everyone says. Nobody knows who he is. He's a, he's a puppet for crying Chuck Schumer I guess. That's about it. Anyway, so good luck. John James everyone. You have to do it. Okay. Another great gentleman, House Speaker Lee Chatfield. [Inaudible]. Good, good.",Donald Trump
"Nice to see you, Lee. Here, you doing good? And a, a woman who is, uh, like special to this part of the world because she headed up our campaign. And, you know, so she kept calling, calling, ""Please, one more visit,"" because a Republican hasn't won Michigan for many, many years, decades, a long time. So she'd called. ""Please come over."" So I'd do it.",Donald Trump
"And, ""Come over. Could I do it again?"" And I came so much I felt like I should become a citizen of your state. That could happen. That could happen. But, you know, uh, she would just say, ""One more time."" So now it's toward the end, toward the end and I called and I said, ""How we doing?"" She said, ""You're gonna maybe win, but you have to do just one more visit.",Donald Trump
"That's all."" So I did one more. I said, I wished her well and I said, ""Hey, the elections in three days and I wanna just thank you for working so hard."" ""Thank you very much. I won't call you again."" I got home and I got a phone call from her. She said, ""You need one more time,"" right? ""One more time."" And I came and we ended up, right?",Donald Trump
"Was that some time? And we ended up, I started speaking at 1:00 in the morning. Now it was election day, and we had 32,000 people. Is that right? We had 32,000 people and I looked and I said, it was 1:00 in the morning, and you know, Barack Hussein Obama, and Hillary came, and Bill Clinton came, and they all came, the whole group.",Donald Trump
"And it was an emergency because they heard they were gonna lose. And when they heard that, Ronna called up and she said, ""You know, if you can, well it'd be good 'cause they're all coming."" It's like an emergency. Now their visit was at 7:00 which is primetime. They had 500 people. I started speaking at 1:00 in the morning.",Donald Trump
"We had 32,000. So it's now election day. And she just got me and she, she loves your state, I will tell you that. And she was so good, I said, ""You know what? We have to pick somebody now to run the RNC."" That's the Republican National Committee. It's a big deal. I said, ""How about that woman from Michigan?"" I mean, she just doesn't stop.",Donald Trump
"And I'll tell you, she has done a fantastic job. Ronna, come on up here. Come on up. Come on up [Inaudible]. Come on. You wanna talk here? Here. Come here. Come here. Talk to them.",Donald Trump
"Thank you Mr. President. Hello Michigan! Lightening struck four years ago and we blew the minds of the media and the world when we delivered Michigan for President Trump. Are we ready for lightening to strike twice? Everyone get out and vote. We need to vote. Call your neighbors, your friends, your family.",Donald Trump
"If you have wronged somebody, make it right, and get them to go vote. Let's make America great again and reelect our fantastic president.",Donald Trump
"No, she did a great job, [Inaudible]. We all love her. We love her. She's fantastic. She's got a spirit like you wouldn't believe. Thank you, Ronna, very much, and for the work. And I think we're gonna have a fantastic day. It's gonna be an incredible day and it's going to be, uh -- You know, I never thought I'd say it, but this election is more important than 2016. I never thought I'd say it.",Donald Trump
"This is going to be, because we can't allow this to happen to our country, this will be the most important election in the history of our country. It's going to set a course, it's gonna go one way, or it's gonna go another, and if it goes the other way, it's gonna be a terrible thing. It's gonna be a terrible thing.",Donald Trump
"So, get out there and vote. It's going to be -- We're gonna, we're gonna win this. We're gonna win it. We're winning all over. They have no idea what's going on. They have no idea. We see the real numbers. And, you know, it's no longer based on polling. We see what, you know, the early voting's come in.",Donald Trump
"They're supposed to be way ahead, right, in the early voting, you know. Then we catch them on election day. I don't know, for whatever reason, that's the way it is. We vote on election day. Uh, they're not way ahead, and they're having a lot of problems. And they have emergency calls out to people, it's going to be very interesting.",Donald Trump
"Let's do the great red wave, okay? [Crosstalk]. And get that guy in, too, Johns. Get him in, we need him. We need him in Washington. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the good old USA.",Donald Trump
"It's about time. The troops are coming back. They're policemen. We're serving as policemen all over the world, we're policeman. No, it's not what it's all about. For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young black men super-predators. To every black American, I am asking you to go out and vote for Donald J. Trump.",Donald Trump
"This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you, and to betray you. And nobody's done it worse than him. I'm fighting for you. I got you criminal justice reform, prison reform. Opportunity zones with Tim Scott. Great guy, Tim Scott. And funding for historically black colleges and universities which were treated extremely badly.",Donald Trump
"Under my leadership, we achieved so much. So much. You know, I said that, and I made the statement during the debate. Nobody saw the debate last week, did you? Nobody? Two weeks ago. It was good. Good debate. But I said, ""Nobody, with perhaps the exception of Abraham Lincoln -- "" A lot of people said, ""Could you do the perhaps the exception of, please?"" "" -- has done more for the black community than Donald Trump."" And that's true.",Donald Trump
"President Trump. All those things and more, and that's good. And you know what? It's showing up, too. Uh, when you look at Florida, take a look at those numbers tomorrow. They are -- And Hispanic. Do you see what's going on with Hispanic, Hispanic numbers in Florida? They're saying, ""What's going on with Hispanic?"" Hispanic Americans love Trump, and I love them, and I have for a long time.",Donald Trump
"The black community is, uh, is going to a level that nob -- we haven't seen in a long time. It's been a, it's a beautiful thing to watch. And they are saying, ""What is going on?"" This could be something very interesting that you're going to be watching. You're going to be watching some very good television tomorrow night.",Donald Trump
"Very good television. Well, you have to say, four years ago, was that like the most exciting evening in the history of television? Remember? Remember how it started? This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. This will be very easy, very short. And then they say, ""Donald Trump has won the State of Ohio."" But it wasn't just that, we won by eight points.",Donald Trump
"Oh, by the way, Ohio is doing great, too. Doing great. Then it's, ""Donald Trump has won the State of Florida. Donald Trump has won Georgia. He's won South Carolina. He's won their firewall, North Carolina, and he won it by a lot. What's going on? Donald Trump has just won Wisconsin. He's just won Michigan!""",Donald Trump
"And they held Pennsylvania, even though it was, you know, we only had -- It was 98% of the vote was in. If I lost every vote in the two percent, I still would've won, by a lot. They, they held it. So you and Wisconsin got credit. And that's okay, right? But I just told Pennsylvania, ""Next time you take credit.",Donald Trump
"So let's do it a little bit earlier, please."" We're gonna, we're gonna do fantastically in Pennsylvania. But that was one of the most exciting evenings ever, and I, I think we're gonna duplicate it. I don't know. Can you ever surpass something like that? But, we're going to at least duplicate it. And we need it carry on what we've been doing.",Donald Trump
"We've brought so many jobs back and all of those plants that we talked about. We have plants. You had nothing for 42 years, just people leaving, nobody coming. And now, they're coming back and they're coming back in droves and the numbers are fantastic. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure Southern border in US history.",Donald Trump
"The Biden Harris group would increase refugees from terrorist nations by over 700 percent -- And that's the manifesto that was agreed to with Crazy Bernie -- Including from Syria, Somalia and Yemen. Right? You know that. The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the entire Midwest into a refugee camp.",Donald Trump
"You're talking about tremendous amounts of people coming into our country. We don't know who they are. We don't know anything about them. I'm protecting your families and keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your country, if that's okay with Michigan. If that's okay with Michigan. If it's okay with you.",Donald Trump
"You know, we put the ban on because we want people to come into our country who are gonna love us, who are gonna help us, not people that are gonna hurt us and blow up buildings. We invested 2.5 trillion dollars in the US military, the largest investment in the military we've ever made. We have to do it.",Donald Trump
"All made in the USA. A lot of it made right here in your great state, a lot of it. And we now have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world, fighter jets, F35's. We have the best tanks. We have the best rockets and missiles. We have the hydrosonic missile that goes seven times faster right now, than the fastest missile in the world.",Donald Trump
"If it went by us, we'd say, what was that? It would start over there and before you could turn your head, it would be over there. No, it goes seven times. Think of that. Seven times faster. It's incredible. And we have all of these things, and our nuclear arsenal now is in tippy top shape. And you know what I say?",Donald Trump
"Pray to God we never have to use it. All of it. All of it. All of it. We're making submarines, the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. We're doing it all. And when I took over, it was depleted. Our military was depleted. We had old fighter jets. You had to go to the desert, it was called the graveyard, for airplanes.",Donald Trump
"Right? And you'd strip planes that were sitting in the desert, rotting in the desert, and you'd bring the parts back. This was what we were flying in our airplanes. Now, we have new tankers. We have the new super fighters. It's incredible what we've done, and much of it's already here, most of it. Much of it's coming.",Donald Trump
"But, it's all made in our great country. We're also, we were passed, we just passed the VA Choice and VA Accountability. And, nobody thought that could be done, and we just got, as I told you, 91 percent approval from our vets, our great vets. We obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. People don't talk about that.",Donald Trump
"When I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place. We obliterated. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi, and we eliminated the world's top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.",Donald Trump
"They were working on that for 52 years. And instead of endless wars, we're forging peace all over the Middle East. They're all getting together. They're all getting together. A vote for me and the Republican party and John James and everybody, it's a vote for the American Dream. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make American into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China, once and for all.",Donald Trump
"That's already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God's help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, and keep -- That's right. You better get out there and vote. And we will defend keep and bear arms.",Donald Trump
"You know what keep and bear arms? It's called the Second Amendment, which is under siege constantly. That's where we need John and everybody to help us, and out great Congressmen. They've been so great and we appreciate it. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength.",Donald Trump
"We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices beyond any levels you've ever seen: 60, 70, 80%. I've instituted ""Favored Nations,"" and drug companies do not like me. They do not like me. They're taking out more commercials, I think, than Sleepy Joe. But we're going to get it done.",Donald Trump
"Our prices are the highest in the world for many years, by far. And we're bringing them down to the lowest price anywhere in the world, matching the lowest price. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars.",Donald Trump
"We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust."" For years, you had a President who apologized for America.",Donald Trump
"Now you have a President who is standing up for America, and standing up for the great people of Michigan. Tomorrow, you have the power, with your vote, to save America. You are going to save America. It's the most important election. I say it all the time. I pa -- This is the most important election our nation has ever had.",Donald Trump
"I really believe that. I never thought I would have said that in a million years, if you go back four years. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get your boss, and drag him out, and say, ""Boss, come on, vote."" You gotta get out and vote. Get out and vote. It's so important.",Donald Trump
"The red wave, I talk about it. The red wave, I think it's going to be far bigger -- Look at all of these organic things that formed in Iowa and the farm country. Tractors, thousands and thousands of tractors. Yesterday, didn't they have 100 miles of cars? It was like 100 miles. All over the country, 4 or 5, 6,000 boats with, Trump, Trump, and the American flags all over.",Donald Trump
"It never happened. You know, th-- A movement like this has never happened before. It's never happened, and we have to keep it going and finish it out. From Midland to Mackinaw, from Lansing to Grand Rapids. And you know where my last stop is going to be? I'm sorry to tell you that. I feel a little guilty.",Donald Trump
"But Grand Rapids was where we did that final great stop. Grand Rapids. So I'm going to be, uh -- I'm going to be in Grand Rapids. It's going to be my last stop. There's something nice about that. Right? Because you can believe it. So I've done -- I have five of these today, and they're all big monsters.",Donald Trump
"I had five of these today. But I actually had six, because yesterday, in Miami, we left the stage at 1:30 in the morning. So somebody said, ""If you want"" -- They said, ""So if you want, you could say you did six today."" I think I'm going to say that. Nobody else could do six of these. Do you think it's easy up here?",Donald Trump
"It's not easy. It's freezing up here, too. I got the wind. You don't have that. I have the wind. I'm freezing my ass off up here. Only for Michigan. And from Battle Creek and right here, in Traverse City. It's a good place. Right? It's a good place. Huh? We inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom.",Donald Trump
"We stand on the shoulders of American heroes, who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads. Right? Raised up the great skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single-greatest nation in the history of the world.",Donald Trump
"And the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come, and I mean that. Proud citizens, like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working.",Donald Trump
"We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Winning, ooh. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Michigan we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again.",Donald Trump
"We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. Go out and vote. Thank you very much.",Donald Trump

"Well, thank you very much and hello, Kenosha, it's nice to be back. It's nice to be back. We spend a lot of time with you, a little law and order, we brought law and order to Kenosha. That's what we want. Hello, Wisconsin. Big day tomorrow, big, big day, big day. And I think we're going to do very well in Wisconsin, just like we did four years ago.",Donald Trump
"And it's an honor to be with you. Thank you. And this is a lot of people this is a lot of people. See, you know what that means? That means we don't have to pay for the microphones because they did a bad job. Tomorrow, we are going to win this state and we are going to win four more years in the white. And with your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment is under siege, but don't worry about it unless Sleepy Joe got in and you can forget about your Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA.",Donald Trump
"Next year we will be and you know, we're going to be together next year. We're going to be together for four more years and we're going to be together forever because we're doing things that nobody's ever done and we're doing them together. And it was my pleasure to be with you a number of months ago when when you had that, you were in the news, right?",Donald Trump
"You were in the news.  Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. And I hope you can hear can you hear back there, by the way? Yes. No, I'll let. OK, that was the problem that you got to get the microphone. What's wrong here? How is that is that getting better? And there was supposed to pay these people right now.",Donald Trump
"Is that better? Come on. OK, we'll do this, we'll have to improvise, you know, sometimes. OK, you ready? Avoca which is better, this one or this one? Which one? This one. Is that better? Can you hear? It's going to be a very uncomfortable evening for me. All right. Well, come on. Let's go. Good job, fellows.",Donald Trump
"I'm always saying I want to perfect my good job. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Is that better now? So this is the first time I've ever used a head held for an hour, two hours, three hours. We have one more tonight after this Grand Rapids, where we finish up at Grand Rapids and we finish up there four years ago and a little bit superstitious.",Donald Trump
Let's do it the same way. We came here. We came to Grand Rapids. Let's keep it going. And I hope everyone can hear me now. Yes. Yeah. All the way back there. All the way back. Good. You let me know you're not you're not shy. I was wondering everyone. I thought they didn't like me. I was saying I'm not sure.,Donald Trump
"I said, what's going on over here? Right. Good. Thank you very much. So under my leadership,  our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, thirty three point one percent fastest ever recorded. We created a record eleven point four million jobs in the last five months. That's a record. And while foreign nations are in freefall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world.",Donald Trump
"A recent Gallup poll found that 56 percent of Americans say they're better off today than they were four years ago.  That's under the auspices of Barack Hussein Obama and sleepy Joe Biden. You're not going to want to have Joe Biden. You know, if we had to see the media, look at all the media back there, if we had if they had a cover, if they had to cover him for two months, let's say we have to bring the president back.",Donald Trump
"We have to break. We have to bring Trump back. They would be out of business. They would be out of business. Biden, Harris and the radical left gained power. They will collapse our economy and send your nation, this wonderful nation, into a depression. That was is what you know, they want it. This is the only guy I've ever seen who runs by saying we will he doesn't say like that.",Donald Trump
"He goes, well, we will raise your taxes. I never heard that before. You know, I've covered politicians. I've been friends of politicians. I've been enemies also. But I've never seen somebody saying we will raise your taxes. They want to give you the largest tax increase in the history of our country. And we can't let that happen.",Donald Trump
"We can't let that happen. So get out and vote. Tomorrow is the biggest. Tomorrow will be, I think, will be the most important election in the history of our country. And I never thought I'd say that. I never thought I. So get out and vote. Sleepy Joe Biden will raise your taxes, four trillion dollars massively, increase your regulations, shut down your farms, close down your factories.",Donald Trump
"How's he doing so far? Send your jobs overseas and start booing them. I don't know if this guy really think it, but I mean, this. Could he really win or was serious about this? What the hell is going on? Is he serious guy has no clue. He shot some people a shot he shot. Did you see him today with the the aviator's? Right.",Donald Trump
"The glasses came on very tough. He's very agitated. You know, it's like sort of like going crazy, I think. Destroy the suburbs, dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private health care, confiscate your guns, Second Amendment is a deep trouble. Not with me it's not. It hasn't. You noticed it hasn't been touch, right?",Donald Trump
"It hasn't been touched. You think that was easy, wasn't easy. And indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies.  So I just signed an executive order to teach our students pro American values,  pro-American. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and ban fracking. Now, from your standpoint, you don't like it because you don't want energy costs going up, right?",Donald Trump
"That's what he do. Biden's energy plan will send every state into crushing poverty. From Wisconsin to Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, as long as I am president, will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And we are. And we will remain energy independent. You know, we're energy independent, we don't need foreign nations anymore, but we have good relationships in the Middle East, you know, where we're doing peace in the Middle East.",Donald Trump
"You believe it? No blood in the sand. Peace in the Middle East. Joe Biden is a globalist who spent forty seven years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure. On Foreign Wars, you know what they call them, the endless foreign wars countries that many of you have never heard about.",Donald Trump
"Wow. I don't know, I think we're doing fine with this, Mike, right? I don't want to put this guy under pressure. You're on stage. You got twenty seven thousand people watching. You don't get nervous. He's not nervous. He's a professional. I'll give you the name of his company, never use that company. No, it's fine.",Donald Trump
"Don't worry about it. This is OK. This isn't bad. Do you want to. Oh, you want to just put it in there, or is it the same Mike as the other one? It's a different mike, that means that we're supposed to be better, right? That's not good. All right. OK, we'll take that sucker out of there, right? Congratulations.",Donald Trump
"How's he doing? He's doing a good job, right? Come on. Now we're back where we started the whole deal. We're right back where we started, I take the mike out. OK. OK. You know what, and then I won't pay the bill of the company that does this crazy makeover and they'll do a story, Trump is a horrible human being.",Donald Trump
"It is on paper. No, I don't like to pay bills when people do a bad job. You don't either. But I don't know. They look like nice people. They come from Kenosha. So I'm going to pay the bill anyway. What?  You know what?  At least I prove one thing, you know. Did you ever see where I live? The glass of water and I wear the red tie, this sort of expensive and you know, you don't like to spill water on the red tide, right?",Donald Trump
"So sometimes I'll use two hands and because I want to catch the water, because I want to save that because I'm basically cheap, you know. So I'll take the water to go like this and I'll take a little sip and they'll say there's something wrong with him. There's something there's something I'm trying to save.",Donald Trump
"So I go like this. So now by holding a mic all night long like this, you're going to say, well, there's nothing wrong with that right hand or left hand. Now, did you ever hear that there's something wrong? You can't lift a glass of water? No, I have no problem with that. Some someday I may like Joe,  but I don't have any problem.",Donald Trump
"Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Wisconsin lost half of your manufacturing. Think of it. You lost half of your manufacturing jobs after the betrayals. These were betrayals by a lot of people, and Biden was one of them. He's a corrupt politician and he sold out Wisconsin to China, but he's a corrupt politician.",Donald Trump
"And these people never told you that. And they don't want to write about it. And Big Tech doesn't want to talk about it. And it's off bounds and they're not allowed to talk. And we have suppression. We have suppression. This is a media suppression, the likes of which nobody has ever seen. And if you take a look, you've never seen anything like it with the less famous last words.",Donald Trump
"But but no, nobody's ever seen anything like it. You know, his son walks in. His son had no job. He left the military. Unfortunately, it was a good. And then what happens is the father becomes vice president and this kid becomes like a human vacuum cleaner. He follows the father into countries, then who are you going to today?",Donald Trump
"Well, let's go to China. And is a vacuum cleaner follows the father takes in money. It's terrible. They give him one and a half billion dollars, one and a half billion one. And I think of it, one and a half billion dollars. And he gets fees off that millions of dollars a year. There's only one problem. He has no experience investing money.",Donald Trump
"They give him the money. They gave him the money after ten minutes. I think our Congress has to take a look at that. What do you think? Well,  I think you're going to have to look at it. Can you imagine you have a lot of my kids here tonight. Can you imagine if my kid said, Yeah, Dad, I got a billion and a half dollars from China?",Donald Trump
"Oh, I don't think they'd want to write about that. The fake news. Do you think that right about that. Then he gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow, his wife, right. What did he get that for? Remember I asked that at the debate? The first debate, I said it. Chris Wallace thought it was an inappropriate question.",Donald Trump
"Really?  I think. You think Chris Wallace. Now, I must tell you, I think Kristen did a better job. Kristen Welker. Right. And I don't mean she was perfect. Actually, some people said she wasn't really very nice. I thought she was nice. Relatively speaking, she was great. For what I get, how about the one, Savannah Guthrie?",Donald Trump
"You see that one? That was that was another beautiful live at 9:00. It's like she's jumping out of a chair. She's, like, going crazy. But we all do well, you know, I don't get questions like he gets he gets, sir, what kind of ice cream you eat. Did you see that? They never asked me questions like that. In twenty sixteen, Wisconsin voted to fire this crap.",Donald Trump
"And really, it's like corrupt, corrupt political establishment. Right. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first and finally putting America. And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician, right? If I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment is because I was elected to fight for you and nobody has ever fought harder for you than I am.",Donald Trump
"I will tell you nobody. When the violent mob came to Kenosha, Biden opposed sending in the National Guard. Of course, you remember this, right? He did. He didn't want to send in the guard. He thought it was terrible to send in the guy. And we sent in the guard and we saved Kenosha.  We saved you know, they said, you know, I think Kenosha is going to like me.",Donald Trump
"We did a good job. Now we say send him in a little bit earlier. Right. If we had him in a little bit earlier. But that's OK. That's OK. But we sent in. And how good did the Guard do the did we do the job that they did the. Vitellin Kamala, does anybody know who Kamala is, that is wonderful woman She wants to be your first female president.",Donald Trump
"I don't think so. I don't think so. You know, that's a good reason not to vote for Sleepy Joe, too, right? You don't want to do that. You want to have we all want to see that happen someday, but we don't want this to be the one. Right. But they're waging war on our police. You know that. You police what?",Donald Trump
"Do you have a lot of police here tonight? I recognize it because. Because I went and I met all of the police, I met a lot of great police, federal police, I met the whole group, and you have great police. I agree with that, but I said with the heroes of law enforcement that I was honored to be endorsed by Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth.",Donald Trump
"Thank you, David, wherever you may be Wednesday. Thank you, David. That was so nice. That was so nice. They like you out there, David. That's very good. Appreciate it, David. Thank you very much. And as I'm sure you've heard, Biden's far left supporters are threatening to loot and riot tomorrow if they don't get their way of their own, get their way.  Are we already, David, everybody ready to fight if they know we're ready?",Donald Trump
"And if they know we're not playing games, they won't even be here. They won't show up. You know, it's like I brought an old law into existence when I saw them. We around all over the country knocking down statues and monuments. And we signed we brought it in and I signed it, updated it, signed it. Ten years in prison.",Donald Trump
"If you knock down a statue or monument and you don't see it anymore, they look and they say, oh, we'd like to knock that one down. But you know what? Ten years is too much. Darling, let's leave now. This is yet more evidence why the radical left cannot be trusted with power. We strongly condemn political violence.",Donald Trump
"We condemn it and we condemn it strongly. Biden must tell his supporters he doesn't really have supporters. Let's face it. He doesn't have supporters. They got shot, he doesn't have this, there's an ideology that has supporters and he's just a vessel, you know, he happened to be the one that got through because Elizabeth Warren, instead of getting out like she should have and letting Bernie take it.",Donald Trump
"Bernie, I got to tell you, he he is a great loser. He really is. He loses. It happened with Hillary and it happened with Elizabeth Warren. What she did was incredible. You know, that's a similar philosophy. But Biden ended up being there. Biden ended up being there, and that's the way it is. And he has to tell his supporters, and I think you're going to see something.",Donald Trump
"Look at the people over here they go. Oh, hello. Can you actually hear this? Can you hear this? Because it's the worst microphone I've ever used in my life. Can you actually hear me over there? They can in the back, all the way back. That's good. Thank you. I can't believe it. It sounds terrible to me. His silence is that it doesn't sound right to me.  It doesn't suck.",Donald Trump
"It's all right. Good. You know what I keep saying? That Bill. He says, don't pay them. Don't pay him. You hear that, Johnny? Don't pay the damn bill, will you please a piece of garbage? I it's not even the first rate bank. The one the good one is, is it's put to rest. We put it to the good one. We put the rest.",Donald Trump
"All right. Don't pay a. But as president, I will ensure peace and order in this country. We are going to have peace order. And you're going to have a day tomorrow, the likes of which I think people haven't seen in a long time. Well, you're going to have a redway. It's going to be a beautiful sight. And you know what?",Donald Trump
"We have a lot of we have we actually have a country that outside of a radical group and this is a radical group, but we have a country that's very well united. When you look at a group of people like this, it's incredible. And I go from here I go, I told you, Grand Rapids, we have they say they have 40, 50 thousand people in Grand Rapids.",Donald Trump
"Last night in Florida, we had forty five thousand people. No problem. Everybody's in love. Everybody loves our country. It's a beautiful thing. I'm telling you this. There's a lot of unity. We just don't complain. You know, we don't complain. We just go out and do what we have to do. But, you know, when we were having that incredible run, we were doing the best and now we're almost at that same point that we'll be there soon.",Donald Trump
"But our country was uniting. We were getting calls. We had the best employment numbers ever, African-American, Asian, American, Hispanic, American. And we were getting calls like maybe it's time we get together, you know, because success brings people together, success brings people together. And you're going to see that happening.",Donald Trump
"Because we're having numbers, the likes of which we've never had before. Thirty three. Think of it, thirty three point one percent, nobody's ever had that the highest was nineteen fifty two and it was less than half of that number. So rioting, looting and arson will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.",Donald Trump
"I'm just telling you that right now. I'm telling you that right now that if people are, you know, I hate to see where they put boards up on a window, this shouldn't be that. It shouldn't be that. But we are going we are a country of law and order. We have to be who we are and people. And you notice I hate to say it, but it's true.",Donald Trump
"This is a these are Democrat mayors and governors. He's a Democrat, run cities and states. They're the ones who if you look at New York and Chicago and how about Portland, which is anarchists, we could solve that problem. We tell the governor, you want us to solve the problem, we solve it in 30 minutes.",Donald Trump
We solved it in Seattle.,Donald Trump
"We went in. We were going to go in the morning. We announced we're going in in the morning. And they just raised their hands and they left the night before. Then we did a great job in Minneapolis. We did a great job. We're going to win Minnesota for two reasons. We did a great job. Now, they could have called.",Donald Trump
"They could have let us do it a week and a half early. That would have been nice, you know. Right. So that the announcer, remember,  the anchor you looked over says this is a peaceful protest.  Thank you. What a group, one group, what a group, I've gotten to know this state very well. You know, you surprised, you know, you're the one that put us over the top.",Donald Trump
"You know that,  right? Remember, we were waiting for Pennsylvania four years ago. We're waiting for Pennsylvania. They didn't want to call it. Oh, they were going crazy. These people, they were crying. They didn't know what the hell was happening. They said this will be a very short evening for Donald Trump four years ago.",Donald Trump
"Right. And they were just oh, they were looking forward. Remember the woman crying in the convention center? That beautiful. Remember the woman who is going crazy glasses? God, she was she's I wonder where she is right now because they put her away. No,  this was not a person that I was easily going to convince to be on my side.",Donald Trump
"I think she was going crazy. But remember, at the beginning of the show, everyone's happy, everyone's thrilled. They spent a fortune. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in terms of a stage they had it shaped like the United States. Hello back. Are you OK?  But that was a hell of an evening and this evening is going to be I'm telling you, tomorrow it's going to be.",Donald Trump
"I can't say there was was there ever anything as big, I'll tell you, the election is more important, but the evening will be as good or almost as good, and that's OK, too. But that was a phase, right? That was the first that was something that I was some evening. He won Florida. He won Ohio. He won it all.",Donald Trump
"Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And because of the microphone, we are giving you back half of your admission price, but considering that you paid nothing, I'm sorry you got the prices right now, it's fine. But, you know, it wasn't that something, though, where they say the evening begins and they say this is going to be very quick.",Donald Trump
"You know what happened? They did exit polls and a lot of the people said none of your business or who did you vote for? None of your business. That meant Trump. And they did 44 percent. You know that. Forty four percent of the people said none of your business. And that meant Trump. They call it the none of your business vote, but almost all of them.",Donald Trump
"I think maybe all of them were Trump. So they didn't count them. So they said, oh, this is going to be a blowout tonight. But they didn't realize, you know, these pollsters haven't been doing so good with me and we blew it out. It was incredible. It started with Ohio. Remember, we're going to do great in Ohio tomorrow, too, by the way.",Donald Trump
"Great place. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. That's a big sign. You know, I heard for a year when we were doing this, you cannot win unless you win the state of Ohio. Every night they did it and then all of a sudden poll numbers started coming out that I was leading in Ohio. But anyway. But they thought I was going to win by one point.",Donald Trump
"I won by eight. They said he won Ohio. He won by eight points. What the hell is going on here?  That's a lot. And then they said, oh, no, oh, no, please don't tell me this, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida.  No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please remember Martha Raddatz, ABC. Oh, my God.",Donald Trump
"Oh, please, please don't tell me this. Oh, no, I'm neutral. I'm I'm very neutral. I don't. Please Martha in neutral. Please. The tears wipe them away quickly. No, then we won Florida, then we won Georgia, then we went South Carolina, then we won the firewall was remember North Carolina? That's the firewall we are going to win North Carolina, they have they put so much money into North Carolina.",Donald Trump
"But we had an asset from North Carolina named Lara Lara, Lara Trump, married to married to the legendary Eric Tropp. Where are you? Are you two there? We had a we had a big asset there, Laura Trump, and she knew that area so well and they loved her so much. They loved her so much and they just had another baby and they named the baby Carolina, they named the baby Caroline.",Donald Trump
"And I tell you, though, but I say we have to give South Carolina some credit, too, for that. Break them up, come on up, get over. Come on, bring them up. Break them up. Right. Come on. Come on, Laura. This one, they love her in North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania. And they love her in Wisconsin, too.",Donald Trump
"Here you go. I'm done. Now, apparently, Wisconsin,  who here is ready for four more years? A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for freedom, a vote for Donald Trump is a voice vote for the future. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for a god and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for America. How do you guys feel?",Donald Trump
"Are we going to win Wisconsin? Let's go do this a second time. Thank you. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you, honey. Thanks, Eric, thanks, Twitter. They're doing a good job. They're working hard. I'll tell you, they're all working hard. They're all working hard. We have a whole group of families, like a family reunion tonight.",Donald Trump
"Well, you know, this is now the big time because tomorrow's the big day and we have one more stop to actually, you know, I did five today, but I could say I could say I did six because in Miami we finished it close to two o'clock in the morning. So let's say I did six today. OK, after Grand Rapids, Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media and powerful special interests.",Donald Trump
"You know that they own him, they control him and they know he will always do their bidding. And when he raises three hundred million dollars for this campaign in a short period of time, ask him what deals did you have to make? Because I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time. I can call the Wall Street guys.",Donald Trump
"I know them all. I could say send me twenty five million dollars immediately, please. Yes, sir, Mr. President, I will. But, you know, once you do that, you're totally compromised. You can't do anything properly once you do that. And I say, I don't want to do that. And we we did very well with the fundraising stuff, but a lot of it came in small donations.",Donald Trump
"First time a Republican has ever raised a lot of money with small donations like sixty one dollars average or something like that. Every corrupt force in American life has betrayed you and hurt you. And they're all supported by Joe Biden, the failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars.",Donald Trump
"They're supported by sleepy Joe Biden, the career politicians that offshored your industries. And you had plenty offshored and decimated your factories. They support Joe Biden, the open borders lobbyists, all the people that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs, gangs and crime. And you know a lot about that.",Donald Trump
"They support Joe Biden, the anti-American radicals, defaming our noble history, heritage and heroes. They support Joe Biden. And that's cancer culture. We don't believe in cancer culture. Antifa and the rioters and looters and Marxists and left wing extremists, they all support Joe Biden. This election comes down to a simple choice do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfish political class or do you want to be governed by the American people?",Donald Trump
"It's what it's all about. It's the American people. They've taken that away. They've taken it away. And what's going on with big tech and what's going on with the media is nobody has ever seen anything like it. There's never been anything like it. Nobody has seen anything like it where, you know, you can't have it.",Donald Trump
"You can't have you can't have a scandal if there's nothing written about it is pretty tough. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists and communists and socialists and wealthy liberal hypocrites, hypocrites who want to silence, censor,  cancel and punish you. These are real, real trouble.",Donald Trump
"If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be respected, if you want your if you want to be just treated with dignity and respect, then I am asking you tomorrow to go out and vote for your all time favorite president. Because we still have work to do. Remember what I said four years ago, I am your voice, and we will all together make America great again.",Donald Trump
"That's what we're doing.  What we've done for the last four years, the deprave swamp has tried everything to stop me. Can you imagine if they didn't do the hoax? The Russia Russia hoax. Right. Russia, Russia, Russia. How about just getting up the other day? The laptop from hell. Right. That's where's Hunter.",Donald Trump
"Where's that there. Where's Hunter. Oh, he's in a country. I see his father just left the country. He's going to scam them for a couple of bucks. Where is Hunter? Nobody's got the laptop from hell. And she got up with the watermelon head like a watermelon and he goes, this was produced by Russia. These people are crazy.",Donald Trump
"I tell you, I a crazy bunch, but they know I don't answer to them. My answer to you. It's true. I'd look, I didn't need this. I didn't need this. I had a very nice life. I had a very nice life. But you know what? The greatest thing I ever did because no administration, no president in the first three and a half years.",Donald Trump
"The biggest tax cut in history, the biggest regulation cuts, rebuilding our military. Look at what we've done. Look at what we've done. Our vets just gave a 91 percent approval rating, the highest in history, the highest in history. Now, look at what we've done. Space. I never even talked about space for us.",Donald Trump
"I never talked. I realized we needed it. After I was in office, I looked. I saw. I saw Russia. I saw China. I said, we need space for us. First time in seventy four years. New one, right. A new one. Right, Congressman? We did we did a great job on it. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will be thrown the failed political class.",Donald Trump
"We will drain the Washington swamp and we will save the American dream. A dream for your children, your grandchildren. Right. A dream for your children and your grandchildren. We have the energy and the people to prove the corrupt media wrong. And that's what we have. We have an energy like no movement has ever had in this country.",Donald Trump
"You know, somebody would go in and do well in New Hampshire as an example, I'm thinking about one man because I have a lot of respect for him. He did well, came in second in a primary, and he became famous for many years. What we did is we won all the primaries, we won everything, and then we won the presidency.",Donald Trump
"Now, there's never been a movement like this and now they go after us illegally. They spied on our campaign. Our campaign is up ass, our campaign. They tried to take out a duly elected president of the United States. And we caught them and we caught them. And let's see what happens to them. And you know who is a part of it?",Donald Trump
"Barack Hussein Obama and sleepy Joe Biden and plenty of others like Neomi, etc., but plenty of others. But they were a part of it. So now we'll see what happens, right? We're going to see we're going to see what happens. So but you have to get out and vote is the biggest thing. Get out and vote. Who, by the way, who's already voted.  But we have a tendency to vote on Election Day Republican.",Donald Trump
"So let me ask you, who is planning to vote tomorrow? A very important, very important. Is anybody planning to vote for sleepy Joe Biden? Please raise your hand. Does anybody have the courage right now to get out and vote? Well, that's good. That's a lot of people. So a lot of you vote a little bit early then.",Donald Trump
"Do you trust the ballot system? Do you do early voting or do you do the ballot early? I like early, but early. As early as good ballot is not good. We got a very horrible, horrible ruling from the Supreme Court of the United States, a ruling that puts our country in danger actually on Pennsylvania. They have so much time to do this thing.",Donald Trump
"Oh, let them put their votes in and give them plenty of time. You know, we have a date. It's called November 3rd. We don't have a date that says many days later we don't have a date that says you're allowed to go and start putting your vote in later and we can tabulate it later. Take you to the whole world is waiting to find out.",Donald Trump
"And there's great danger in that. No. One, there's danger that there's a lot of shenanigans that go on from that time forth. There's a lot of shenanigans and then there's a lot of bad things that can happen with with the streets. I mean, you're going to have a population that's going to be very, very angry and you just can't do that.",Donald Trump
"That is such a dangerous decision. That is such a disappointment when I heard that decision. That's a terrible decision, just you go take a look at it, and I know you people are taking a look at it, but there's not a decision that I've ever heard of like that where people if you want to put your ballot in and if you want to, you go and you put it in two or three or four weeks early, you know, go and put your hand.",Donald Trump
"You said you had a whole year. You had a lot of time. You had a lot of time. So they say, oh, this is so terrible. You know, they gave him extra time and then all the time. So now we're going to be all waiting around because Pennsylvania, we're going to win Pennsylvania. It's a great state. But, you know, it's like you.",Donald Trump
"It's in a total shutdown. They shut it down. The governor is a Democrat. He shut it down. It'll probably open on the fourth. It'll open up the hill and ICE. Ladies and gentlemen, now that the election's over, we're going to open it up. Right. But you can't do that. That's a very, very dangerous decision by the Supreme Court.",Donald Trump
I guess it was a political decision. I don't know what it was. I don't know what they were thinking. And you know what? Maybe I should maybe I shouldn't be speaking this way. I'm very disappointed on behalf of this country that a thing like this can happen because we could be waiting for weeks before we ever find out what's going on.,Donald Trump
"The whole world is waiting for this decision. It's a very sad it's a very sad thing. And hopefully it's going to be changed. Hopefully their wisdom and they have wisdom. Hopefully their wisdom will prevail and they'll do something and lawyers will be going in and they'll be fighting. And, you know, but people in fact, it's all over television tonight.",Donald Trump
"I'm coming from place to place and them. The good thing about Air Force One, it's got more televisions than any hotel room in the world. OK, you have them on the floors, you have them on the ceilings, you have them all over. And you see the comments that are being made about the decision. And some of the pros are saying this is a very dangerous decision for our country because so many things I mean, they're going to say, well, how many votes short our we we need 6000 votes.",Donald Trump
"Well, let's take six thousand of these. We'll put them over here. Let's take six thousand of these. It's going to be cheating. It's going to be cheating. It's like they are putting these people. And you know what? We don't consider the people that have been running elections in Philadelphia, to be very honest.",Donald Trump
"We've had a lot of problems with Philadelphia. So that's the story. And hopefully that'll be changed. And I'm sure the people would say, oh, you shouldn't speak that way about the Supreme Court. We've had so many bad decisions out of the Supreme Court that I will speak that way. And that's the way it is.",Donald Trump
"This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown and a safe vaccine that ends. And by the way, we're rounding the turn anyway. But we have great vaccines. We have great vaccines coming. We have great vaccines coming. And it's a lot of good things are happening. And, you know, when you look at the therapeutics excuse me, you're right.",Donald Trump
"I'm right here. No, I don't think the therapeutic help me. I don't think I needed it. I'm glad I got it right. Regeneron, we're going to make it available free to anybody that needs it. We're making it available free to anybody that needs it free. But I'll tell you what, I'm sure I didn't because I'm you know, I'm a perfect physical specimen and I am considered very, very young.",Donald Trump
"I'm considered young for my age now. I'm a perfect specimen. I'm in perfect shape. So I'm sure I would have thrown it away. But no, but I had it. And the next morning I was not feeling good at all. I tell you, the doctor said, Sir, I hate to say it. You've just tested positive. I said, Doc, Sean, a great doctor, White House doctor.",Donald Trump
"I said, Sean, tell me, what does that mean? Tested positive for what, sir? You've tested positive for the China Plague. You know, he used it much nicer than he said COVID. He said COVID. You know, it's got about thirty seven names, you know, that we could name. But I always like to have a China in there because I like to be accurate.",Donald Trump
"But but he said, sir, you have tested positive for COVID. I said, I'm in the middle of the campaign. I can't be positive. I COVID. And so anyway, so I was and I didn't feel too good and the first lady had it. At least now you know that all those rumors is that she lives in Virginia. Separate. I mean, at least now, you know, she lives in the White House because she got it probably for me or whatever.",Donald Trump
"I don't know what the hell you know. Do you ever hear the first lady lives in Virginia, a beautiful house over a rivers of the. No, no, she lives here, but at least that. And then I know people love the first lady. They love the Steube. They love the first lady. It's true. I love her. She's doing a good job.",Donald Trump
"They love that whole family back there. They love that family back there. Great family. Hi, Tiffany. So so then Soleimani has it, but she knocked it out pretty good and I did a great job, you know, I was surrounded by these doctors, 12 doctors have told the story. Each one was a specialist at Johns Hopkins.",Donald Trump
"Walter Reed Medical Center is incredible. You know, that's our military center. It's incredible. And I'm surrounded. Right. I'm just surrounded by these brilliant doctors. One thing, when you're president, you get a lot of doctors and each doctor grabbed a different part of my body. And I said, I don't like this at all, but they told me about this one thing and I said, I really do, I like it, I wrote it.",Donald Trump
"But it was very, you know, a little bit early. What we've done with getting it through the FDA has been incredible. Biden wouldn't have this stuff done for years. Well, he had his chance with the swine flu and totally blew it. Right. It was a disaster. It was a disaster anyway. So I wake up the next morning and I'm telling you, I felt like Superman.",Donald Trump
"I was so I wanted to get out. I said, give me another trade deal to renegotiate that these clowns have screwed it up. Give me a trade deal to renegotiate. And where am I supposed to be? Well, sir, could you take it easy for a couple of days? And people are sort of amazed I've done these things, I mean, I do them these are not easy to do, especially when you have no damn microphone.",Donald Trump
"I mean,  I'm working harder on this one than I have on all six that I did today. This is the hardest one because I have a microphone that was obviously meant for congressmen and senators, not for a president. So it's a little bit off. But that's OK. You know, you have to learn how to deal funny when you put it back in here and hand it to me.",Donald Trump
"But that's where we started. I thought that was better. Nobody got that. Only this front row got that one. I thought that was very clever, actually. But then he came up to me, the doctor, he said, Sir, I'm sorry to inform you that your son Barron has tested positive again, I said brilliantly. For what he said, for COVID, I said, oh, that's terrible.",Donald Trump
"Oh, no, he'll be OK, sir. He'll be OK. I said, it's terrible, but he's young and he's strong and he's very tall. Have you ever seen, I say, Haibao, 14 years old. He's very tall. It's he's definitely tall and he's strong, but he's young. And I said, that's terrible. He said, no, he'll be OK, sir, he'll be OK.",Donald Trump
"And I said, well, I hope like 12 minutes later I say, husband doing doctor, sir, he's 100 percent now. He's. Get your kids back to school. OK. Right, get them back to school. All right, so we're going to mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It's going to be coming out very soon. And we will quickly eradicate the virus, wipe out the China plague once and for all.",Donald Trump
"Get it the hell out of here. We will never forget either. We will not forget. That was not good. You know, we made a great trade deal with China, as you know very well. But, you know, the ink wasn't dry before we got this and no good. No good. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state, locking you in your home while you're you're far left.",Donald Trump
"Anarchists are allowed to roam the streets, burn down your cities, hit people over the head. They're allowed to do that. So that's why I always call all of these rallies protests. These are not rallies anymore because you're allowed to have a protest. You can't have a rally and you can't go to church. You know, you're not allowed to go to church, but you're allowed to burn down the cities with the protest.",Donald Trump
"So we always call these friendly protests. The Biden locked out will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no Easter, no Fourth of July and no future. Other than that, it's really not a bad way to go. A vote for sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for a lockdown's layoffs, misery and no fracking.",Donald Trump
"How about the guy? No fracking for over a year and a half. There will be no fracking. He goes to Pennsylvania. Absolutely will frack. OK, and these guys don't do anything about it. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family and freedom to live your life, then you have no choice but to cast your ballot for a gentleman named Donald Trump.  And as I said, you have to remember this, you know, because during the debate, the debate was good.",Donald Trump
"Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. It's a great honor to be with you. I really did during the Kenosha disaster. I really got to be friendly with a lot of people up here long before that, because we've had so many different people that we deal with.",Donald Trump
You have great people.,Donald Trump
"We're going to introduce you to a few of them, but you have great people here. But I really got to know you during that problem, that potential crisis that we put out very, very swiftly once we got called. And it's great. You're great people. You built the country a great people. Joe Biden. And as I said, he ran the H1N1, he called it in one H when he couldn't get it right.",Donald Trump
"He still does. He can't get it right. I said Joe H. Kavanaughs before and it's easy to remember H1N1 swine flu. And he failed horribly. And he was a laughingstock all over Washington, as you remember, and his chief of staff. I don't know why this guy said it, but he made the worst statements. He said, this guy, we have no idea what we're doing now.",Donald Trump
"All of a sudden he's coming and he's he was the one that said I shouldn't close it down to China. Heavily infected China. Right. You remember that mess. And then now he runs. He said I should have closed it sooner. It's it's really disgraceful. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, a respected man. He said Biden has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four years.",Donald Trump
Right. Four years. He said he's always wrong and he has been always wrong. I don't believe he's even running. I can't believe the whole I've watched I watched the debates had twenty seven total killers on the stage and he was there and. But you don't have to believe me because it's you and because it's Wisconsin.,Donald Trump
We spent a fortune and hopefully that'll work better than the microphone. Try it. Put it on. [Begin Video],Donald Trump
"[End Video] Folks,  we got a lot of work to do. I don't need you to get me elected. The case where we cannot let this we've never allowed any crisis from the Civil War straight through to a pandemic is 17 all the way round 16. We have never, never let our democracy six second fiddle way that we can both have a democracy and elections and at the same time correct the public health everywhere.  But here and all around the country, you're trying your best, but it never feels like enough.",Donald Trump
"And here comes the train that he tried to make sure to continue to go up front. Now, that's the commuter line. That's where. But folks, look, anyway, I am I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical, mental health, my physical, as well as my mental fitness, I'll lead an effective strategy to mobilize through the next effort to pressure the.",Donald Trump
"Thank you. What a good job. Jack. Thank you very much. It was just a small little sampling, we had many more. Some were too rough to put on. We just decided. But that said, look. This is not what our country needs. This isn't this isn't about yeah, it is about me, I guess, when you think of it. But but this is not what our country can have.",Donald Trump
"We can't have this one thing. I'll tell you, I learned President Xi of China. President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong un of North Korea and many others, all of them, they're very sharp, they're very smart, they're very sharp. He wasn't sharp 25 years ago. And now it's you can't let this happen to our country.",Donald Trump
"That's all I can say, because it's not a game. We're not playing a game. You know, we have a good time tonight. We love each other. We're having fun. But when you get right there, it's not about fun. We can't let this happen to our country. Joining us tonight, speaking about somebody that's great is a senator who is my friend.",Donald Trump
"He's my friend. And he is a he just doesn't stop. He's one of the sharpest, toughest people in Washington. And he is on when he's on somebody, that person has no chance or that bad group has no chance. He's the head of homeland, but he is a respected person and he's your senator and we love him. And I'm telling you, everybody in Washington talks about him in the greatest of tones, Senator Ron Johnson.",Donald Trump
"Ron, thank you. And he doesn't stop, you talk about not giving up. He doesn't stop, and we have Brian style. Congressman, great job. Great job you're doing. Thank you. Thank you. Very great job you're doing. Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much. Great job. Glenn's doing a great job. Darren LaHood, Darren.",Donald Trump
"Good job, Darren. What a good group. And you have a wonderful candidate who is going to be running. And you know who that is is. Where is he? Where is Jim? Jim. Jim Oberweis. Jim. Thank you, Jim. And I heard you doing well, Glenn. How's he doing in the polls? OK. He said he's going to win. When he says he's going to win.",Donald Trump
"He's going to win. Toker. I heard you doing very well. Good. Very good. State GOP chair Andrew Hit. How are we doing, Andrew? Tomorrow? Good. We're OK because he's doing a nice job. But if we don't win, he'll be fired immediately. And a friend of mine and a guy who's done a terrific job, he loves his state Kenosha his own Reince Priebus, where is he writes, stand up rights, workers rights.",Donald Trump
"What a nice what a good guy he is to what a good guy he's done. Took me years to learn how to pronounce his name properly, but he's a fantastic person. I'm especially glad to be joined tonight by Don Jr. and Kimberly and Don. Come on up there, say, bring them up. Come on, come on up. See, he's a he's a mountain man.",Donald Trump
He loves to go out the hunting. He does it. You don't have a jacket on. You catch a cold. He likes the outdoors. Are you doing OK? Come on. Say hello.,Donald Trump
"Hello Wisconsin. Or if I was Joe Biden, I'd say Florida, but, you know, doesn't matter. You don't have to be right. But thank you, guys. Thank you for the support. We've been seeing it on the ground and every day for weeks, because unlike the Bidens, we don't have a mainstream media that will campaign for us.",Donald Trump
"We have to do it ourselves on the ground with you guys. So we need you to get out and bring your friends to vote tomorrow. And when we do, we can not only keep making America great again, but we can make liberals cry again.",Donald Trump
"Get out there and do it. Wisconsin, get out there and do it. Thank you, guys.",Donald Trump
"Good job. Thank you. Thanks, Kim.",Donald Trump
"Thank you, sir.",Donald Trump
"Thank you very much. And I'll tell you, they're campaigning hard. They're all campaigning hard. They're all campaigning. So I see back there, Ivanka and Jared, Jared is doing peace in the Middle East. Jared is doing a great job, peace in the Middle East. Jared, are you going to get it done? You're going to get it done, Jared.",Donald Trump
"I hope so. Come on up. Come on up. Jared and Ivanka. Come on. Come on. This is like an old home week for you. I look back. The whole family is here. Tiffany, come on up, I see Tiffany, come on up, Tiffany, come on up here, honey, up.",Donald Trump
"Hello, Wisconsin. You have heard my father talk about some of the things that he's been able to accomplish over the past four years, and I am so proud of so many of them. But I will say the thing that I am most proud of is, unlike politicians, he's never forgot why he ran for president and who he is fighting for.  You never forgot.",Donald Trump
"It is a beautiful thing to see. And he works so, so hard every single day. And let me just tell you, Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump has changed Washington. It's true. It's true. And there's more to come. So now we have to fight for him and we have to fight for this country that we love so much and get out and vote tomorrow.",Donald Trump
"Thank you, Wisconsin. We love you and God bless.",Donald Trump
"Thank you, sweetheart. Would you like to say something about peace in the Middle East to this very small crowd?",Donald Trump
"Thank you. It's really an honor to be with all of you. I would just say in Washington, if the things that the politicians were talking about were easy, they would have been done a long time ago. But it took a leader like President Trump to come in and shake things up a little bit. But we've seen things get done that we never imagined could happen.",Donald Trump
And I can tell you the table is set. There is so many more things to do. And this whole family loves America. We love this country. We love all of you. And we will never stop fighting to get all the things done that President Trump has promised. So thank you for your support. Thank you for your love. Thank you.,Donald Trump
"Thank you. Great job, Jared. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, kids. Thanks, everybody. And I see some people. Do I see Corey Lewandowski back there? Yes. Do I see David? Is that David? Come on. Get over here. Corey. Corey Lewandowski. David. Come on. David Bossie. What what a group.",Donald Trump
"Stand up. Just that we don't have to hear from them. The mic doesn't work anyway, so don't worry about it. Great job. Great job. Good luck on television tomorrow. I think you're going to have a blowout tomorrow.",Donald Trump
"OK, but I want to thank. Look, I have a great family. I have a family. They're working all the time, all of them. And we appreciate it. Special people. And we're really you know, we didn't need this. We had a wonderful super I was just going, good. Then I said, you know, maybe I'll give it a shot. You know why?",Donald Trump
"Because of trade. It started because of trade. I hate it. I watched it was so obvious the way we were being ripped off on trade. And I said, let's give it a whirl. And I said to my wife, I'd like to do it. What do you think? She said, Well, you have to really want it because you know you will win, don't you?",Donald Trump
"I said, Do you think so? Really? She had more she had a little more security in the fact that if I ran. No, she said, you will win if you but you have to make sure you want it. I said, I want to do it because we have so many things we could do. I never thought we would have done what we've done. We've done a lot together, together.",Donald Trump
"We've done so much. I mean, you think about all it probably started more. I talk to Ron about I probably started with trade because I hated our companies were leaving to Mexico, Canada, China. They were all leaving our country. We had these stupid laws and horrible tax deals where they had incentives to move to Mexico.",Donald Trump
"They got incentivized to move to Mexico. Somebody had a concept, gee, let's make Mexico great again. You know, I said, no, I want to make our country great again. So that's the story. It's a complicated story, but it all evolved into this evening. And tomorrow we have our big day. And tomorrow I think that I think it's going to be a really special day.",Donald Trump
"And I hope you can all go out. You'll find the time and go out and vote. And we're going to make you very proud. You're going to make you're going to be made really very proud of just finishing off. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders.",Donald Trump
"But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, that we are bringing our jobs and our factories and our troops. Finally, finally, finally, we're bringing them back home to the USA where they belong. For forty seven years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young black men super predators all the time to every black American.",Donald Trump
"I am asking you to go out tomorrow and vote. Very important. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you and to betray you, I'm fighting for you. And we got criminal justice reform, completed prison reform, completed opportunity zones completed with the great Tim Scott of South Carolina and funding for historically black colleges and universities.",Donald Trump
"We got that done. And I say all the time and sometimes people say that's a big statement. Then they realize it's true. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln, there's never been a president that has done so much for the black community. And it's my honor. It's my honor. It is my honor and under my leadership and by the way, I don't know if you've been watching what's going on in Florida.",Donald Trump
"We're doing really well. And you know what they're talking about. The black community and the Hispanic American community is really they like and Trump what's going on now? We're doing very well. Florida. Florida is doing very well. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.",Donald Trump
"It's already begun. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God's help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Your Second Amendment, which is totally under siege.",Donald Trump
"But as long as Ron Johnson and your great congressman are there, we will protect it. Right, Glenn? Everybody, we will protect it. Ron, that's an easy one for us. But it wouldn't be easy if he got it. We wouldn't have enough to say about it. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength.",Donald Trump
"We will end surprized. Medical billing require price transparency starts on January 1st, and it will be bigger than health care. Lower drug prices, even more favored nations. The drug companies do not like me too much. I will tell you what have the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.",Donald Trump
"America will land. The first woman on the moon in the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and we will restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.",Donald Trump
"And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in God We Trust. For years you had a president who apologized to America. We had a system. I mean, we have had I watched Obama go out and apologize all over the world. He would apologize all over the world. He apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great, great people of Wisconsin tomorrow.  You have the power, you have the vote.",Donald Trump
"You have the power really to save America. We can't go down that path. We will never be a socialist country. We will never be. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, grab your boss by the time and say, come on, boss, we got to get out and vote, get out and vote from Madison to Milwaukee, from Janesville to lacrosse and from your team is doing well, right?",Donald Trump
"Your team is doing well. Green Bay. Green Bay. They like you, like your quarterback. I do, I like your quarterback, you know who I like? We like Brett Favre. Do you like you know that Brett Favre endorsed me last week, that we love Brett Favre for that great guy. I got to know him. He's a he's a tough cookie.",Donald Trump
"He's a tough guy. A great, great guy. Green Bay to right here in Kenosha, we inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who cross the oceans, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, lay down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world.",Donald Trump
"And the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning you.",Donald Trump
"We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again, your 401(k)s are doing very well. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again.",Donald Trump
"We're proud again. We're respected, well respected again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you, Wisconsin. Go out and vote. Thank you. It's a great honor.",Donald Trump
"Thank you very much, Grand Rapids. You know, this is -- this was final night prior to a very, very big victory. That was it. Remember? We left it around 1:00 in the morning. I got home. My wife said, uh, now-First Lady said, uh, ""You have to be kidding."" We came home late, and then we watched a beautiful victory, and we're gonna have another beautiful victory tomorrow.",Donald Trump
"And we're going to win the state of -- You know what? We're gonna win this state so easily. We're gonna win the state of Michigan so easily. We wanna do it just like last time, but let's give me a little bit more margin than that if you don't mind. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] So we're gonna win the state of Michigan, and we are going to win four more years in that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful house called the White House.",Donald Trump
"We made history together four years ago, and tomorrow we're going to make history once again. So this has been really -- this was amazing. Grand Rapids, I'll never forget it, though, and you know, we were called, we were called late in the evening. Ronna, thank you very much, wherever you may be. She kept calling, saying, ""One more trip.",Donald Trump
"One more trip to Michigan, I'm telling you. One more trip,"" and then we heard Crooked Hillary was coming back because they were hearing -- [Audience boos] Oh, you know, Michigan hadn't been won for a long time, many, many years, by a Republican. We heard that Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary and -- [Audience boos] -- Bill.",Donald Trump
"Bill was the only one that got it right, said, ""You don't wanna run against Trump. He said that very early."" He was the only one. He's the only one that understood what was going on, actually, but they came, and they came, and they wanted to be in Michigan, which was unscheduled. So I get a call from Ronna and the whole ground, and they said, ""Could you go back?"" We got here at 12:00 in the evening.",Donald Trump
"I started speaking at 12:30, now Election Day. I'll never forget it. We had 32,000, almost as many as we have tonight. And, And I said, I said to my team, ""We have to -- This is it."" You know, we've done five, but actually six because we ended up last night around 2:00 in the morning in Miami. So we can say that includes this, so that would be six.",Donald Trump
"We've done six of these big, and every one was just a lot of people, and you know what? There was a lot of love. There was a lot of love. There was a lot of love. We had 45,000 people in Florida last night. By the way, we're doing very well in Florida. We're doing very, very well in Wisconsin. We're doing very well in Texas.",Donald Trump
"I hear great things about Texas. You know, they're saying Texas may be even. Well, then you think, Sleepy Joe Biden's against guns. That's not good for Texas, right? [Audience boos] He's against oil. [Audience boos] Oil isn't good. If you're against oil, I don't think you're good -- That's not good politics, right, Texas?",Donald Trump
"And he's against God. [Audience boos] Right? So, you know, when you have guns, oil, and God, and he's doing well in Texas. I don't think so. But I actually know for a fact we're doing very well in Texas. I think we're doing very well all over. I think you're gonna have -- I don't know if it's as much of a sup -- I don't what's a surprise.",Donald Trump
"We fulfilled everything we said we were going to fulfill and that's why people are here. And we did somethings that we never even talked about, right? We never talked about Space Force, we got in and I said, ""You know what?"" I looked at Russia, I looked at China, I said, ""We need Space Force and we did it first time in 74 years.",Donald Trump
"Not since the Air Force. But I wanna thank you all. You know, we have a great group of people here. I'd like to show our a appreciation for our phenomenal Vice President, Mike Pence and his amazing wife, Karen. Did he make a good speech? I saw him on the plane and I couldn't sort of -- Did he make a good speech?",Donald Trump
"Uh -- That's, he's great. I'll tell you what. I'll, I -- It was close. It was close. If I had my choice between Mike and Kamala, I think -- It's a very close choice, but I think I'll take, I think I'll take Mike. I think we'll stick with Mike and Karen. No. By the way, how badly did he beat her in that debate?",Donald Trump
"Did you ever hear the expression, ""If that were fight they would've stopped it?"" But anyway -- No, Mike's been great from day one and I appreciate it. I also want to thank Don Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany. Words cannot express how proud you make me every single day. No matter what happens tomorrow, I'm very proud of you all.",Donald Trump
"But, if we don't win I'll never speak to them again. They like him. They like them all. No, no. I'm very, I'm very proud. We're very proud of you. Thank you. Look at these people. There's a lot of spirit here. There's a lot of spirit. No, it's, it's funny though. I kept saying, ""We have to finish off here."" Then we have to do it.",Donald Trump
"It's just, uh, we can be a little bit superstitious, right? But, you people you've been great. You've been great. And I think we're going to have a tremendous victory in Michigan. Don't forget, four years ago we said -- I said, ""Why are so many car companies leaving?"" You know, you were losing everything to Mexico, and to China, and to frankly Canada.",Donald Trump
"And you were losing everything. And we stopped it. And now you have many many car plants that have already been built, are being built. Renovation '17. You didn't have a deal in like 42 years, or so -- It was always going out. Now they're all coming in. I want to thank Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I said, Shinzo, Shinzo, you got to do me a favor, Shinzo.",Donald Trump
"You gotta, you gotta build some plants. And he said, ""No, no, no, we are the government. We don't do that. That's up to the private sector."" I said, ""No, Shinzo, you gotta do it. You gotta do it. It's not fair, you're sending too many cars, and they're built in Japan."" We wanted them built in Michigan. We want them built in Ohio.",Donald Trump
"We want them built in South Carolina, North Carolina. We gotta do it. He says, ""But we do not do that, Donald."" And the next day they announced five companies are coming to Michigan. So -- But he's a great guy. And he retired. He went to, uh, you know. He had some difficulty with, with his health. But he was a great, uh, Prime Minister of Japan.",Donald Trump
"And he did a great favor to Michigan, and to us, all of you. He's a -- We have a lot of, we have a lot of activity in Michigan. It would be nice if your governor would open up the state, however. He ought to open up the state. Open up your schools. Open up the states. Go back. Get back to business. The only one that's allowed to roam free is her husband.",Donald Trump
"What's her husband like? [Audience boos] Remember? That wasn't so long go. He's allowed to do whatever he wants. But everybody else, you're not allowed to leave your house, or your apartment. No, she's gotta open it up. Well, they will. On November 4th, she'll announce, ""Okay, now we're going to open."" You know, they're doing that for political reasons.",Donald Trump
"They think it hurts us in the election. Actually, it helps us, okay? Who has voted so far? Has anyone voted? Okay, good. Because you're saving it, right? You're saving it for Tuesday? Right? No we're good. We're going to have a red wave. They call it the great red wave, like nobody's ever seen before. Like nobody's ever seen.",Donald Trump
"So, based on just, you know, early results though, Florida looks like it's phenomenal. Just phenomenal. North Carolina is looking great. They're all looking -- I think they're all looking great. Ohio is looking fantastic. You know, we won Ohio last time by eight points, and, uh, I said, ""Well, why are -- "" You know, these fo -- these fake polls that they put out, they're called suppression polls.",Donald Trump
"If they make them bad enough, they hope you don't wanna waste your time involved, right? We love our president, but he was losing by 250 points. Let's stay home and have dinner darling. And, uh, it doesn't work, as you people don't -- You don't go for the bait, do you? It's really, it's really amazing, and, uh, I think we're winning.",Donald Trump
"I think we're gonna win everything tom -- I think tomorrow's going to be -- one of the greatest wins in the history of politics. I wanna give a very special thank you also to -- Jared Kushner, who is in the process of negotiating a little thing called peace in the Middle East. Great guy, great guy. They like that.",Donald Trump
"They like the sound. Peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood in the sand, and -- no cost, just peace. Already three countries. UAE, a great leader, Mohammed. Great leader, and, uh, just, you know, three countries have already signed. Bahrain. It's already signed. Sudan -- and we have many, many countries.",Donald Trump
"How many do we have lined up? Like, it'll be more than 10, uh -- Now, what would happen if Sleepy Joe Biden had to take over the deal? You know what happens? That's the end of that deal. [Audience boos] You can forget that deal, the sleepy, the sleepy one. Lara Trump, thank you, Lara. What a job you do.",Donald Trump
"What a job you do. You know, Lara's a specialist on a place called North Carolina, I will tell you. She lived there and she grew up there. They love her there. And Pennsylvania, that extends to Pennsylvania next door, and you said they were doing phenomenally there, right? So, I think that's right. She said, ""Win."" I think it, I think they're both wins, big wins.",Donald Trump
"We gotta be careful, though, because the Pennsylvania deal with that decision, ""Oh, you can count the ballots later on and count them whenever you'd like."" [Audience boos] No, no. We have to be very, very careful with that. That causes a lot of problems. I wanna thank Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly is fantastic, from day one.",Donald Trump
"I'd watch her on the five and she always liked me, right from the beginning, so I always liked her. If they don't like me, I never like them. It's funny the way that works. But she was their big star and she did great, and thank you very much, Kimberly. I appreciate it very much. And Tiffany, thank you for the job you do.",Donald Trump
"She goes around from place to place. She just graduated from law school. She just graduated from Georgetown. She did a great job. Thank you, honey. Thank you very much. Great job, and Michael, thank you very much. Thank you very much. To all of our supporters here tonight, I really wanna thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",Donald Trump
"We've, uh, worked very hard in four years. We've been hit by fake, fake investigations -- fake scandals, fake impeachments. We've had, we've had so many things that, uh, the witch hunt. I call it the witch hunt, and it turned out to be a phony witch hunt, and they should've known it the first day. They did know it the first day, but it's the deep state.",Donald Trump
"It's whatever you wanna call it, but you know, it should've never happened. Think of it -- They spied on our campaign. [Audience boos] They got caught. They tried to take down a duly elected president of the United States. [Audience boos] They got caught, and you know who knew all about it? Barack Hussein Obama and Sleepy Joe Biden. [Audience boos] They knew all about it.",Donald Trump
"They knew all about it. And then I watched the fake news back there. Look at all of them. Look at all of the fake news. Isn't that -- [Audience boos] It's a lot of fake news. Then I watched the fake news saying, ""You know -- ""His attitude is a very tough attitude. He's not very nice. He's a very nasty person."" No, no, we're defending ourselves.",Donald Trump
"We're defending all of these people that voted for us-- with these fake -- And then, what happens? It turns out to be that it was them that were guilty of all of these horrible crimes, including the crime of treason, because when you try and take down a duly-elected President, you know it's called treason.",Donald Trump
"It's called the big stuff, it's big stuff. So, we're gonna see how that all works out. We're going to see how that -- But, that's another reason we want to go for a long time, frankly, because you know what we started something incredible. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We then had to close it down for a period of time.",Donald Trump
"We saved millions of lives. Remember the original estimate was 2.2 million people would die from the China plague, and they could have kept it in China. They didn't get infected in the rest of China after Wuhan Province, but it came out to the world. It came out to Europe, and the United States, and 188 countries all over the world, and we can never forget that.",Donald Trump
"We signed a great trade deal with China but it doesn't mean so much -- The ink wasn't dry and all of a sudden this happened and -- But the job we've done when you see the numbers, and you're going to hear the numbers because they're coming out very soon, the job we've done has been an incredible job. We had to close it up.",Donald Trump
"We saved millions of lives. We now opened it up. You saw what happened, 33.1%. The fastest in the history of our country, the fastest growth, the biggest growth in the history of our country. But, you've been there right from the beginning. We've all been together, and I'll tell you what, we very much appreciate it.",Donald Trump
"Think of how it could have been different, except I think we, in a way we would have been less popular. Somebody said because they would have said, ""Just another Presidency."" This time you know we had to fight for you, we had a fight. You understood it. You understood the hoax better than anybody. It was a hoax.",Donald Trump
"The Russian hoax. And after spending 48 million dollars, 18 angry Democrats, and smart people, vicious, they were vicious, they were smart. If they could find any little morsel, and they went over taxes, and they went over everything you can go over. They spent 48 million dollars, two and a half years, the Mueller Investigation scam, and they come up no collusion.",Donald Trump
"There's no collusion after all of that, which makes me perhaps the most innocent man anywhere in the history of the United States. Now, a friend of mine called me up, very smart guy, he said, ""I can't imagine anybody could go through two and a half years, 48 million dollars, 18 killers, -- "" some of whom worked for Hillary Clinton, right?",Donald Trump
"Crooked Hillary. [Audience boos]"" -- and it turned out they're the ones dealing with Russia. What a disgrace. So, let's see what happens. It's too bad it's going so slowly. There's plenty of info there, and I try and stay uninvolved. Someday I'm going to have to get involved maybe. I try and stay uninvolved.",Donald Trump
"Going too slowly. ""No Sir, we'd rather not do anything before the election."" Well, they did it to me before. They did it during, before, and after. These are bad people. Comey, the worst Director in the history of the FBI. Crooked, a crooked person. ""Did you leak?"" Remember Chuck Grassley. ""Did you leak the information to the newspapers?"" Uh, uh, he choked when he heard.",Donald Trump
"Chuck Grassley from Iowa, great gentleman, great gentleman. He looked at that guy. He said, ""Did you leak?"" And he said, ""Yes."" He choked. You know, the guy choked like a dog, Comey. He leaked, he lied, he did a lot of things. You saw the report by Inspector General Horowitz, who by the way did a great report.",Donald Trump
"That was a great report, Inspector General Horowitz, and I appreciate it. But, you saw that on Comey. Comey should hang his head in disgrace. But, we had to go through all this stuff. Think if we didn't have any of it. We probably wouldn't have done as well. You know, it's true. We might not have done as well, and we might not have these massive crowds, because you saw what was happening.",Donald Trump
"You got it. We might not have had, so I just want to tell you we appreciate you so much. We really do. We appreciate you so much. Now, we have to build on what we've done. Nobody has done what we've done. No administration has done. [Audience chants ""We love you""]Thank you. Wow, I love you, too. I love you, too.",Donald Trump
"Thank you very much. Thank you. That's really nice. You know, in the history of politics nobody's ever heard that expression before. It's true. Look, Ronald Reagan, we liked Ronald Reagan, right, but nobody ever said, ""We love you. We love you."" Nobody's ever heard it before. Nobody's heard it before. It's an expression, sure.",Donald Trump
"You know, they were covering it the other night. They look in the back, oh they want to find it so badly. They want to find somebody so badly. But it's never been said before to the best of anyone's knowledge. And we appreciate it. I tell you what, when you hear that -- I had a nice life. I had the greatest life.",Donald Trump
"But you know what? I'm so happy. This was the greatest decision I ever made, because -- We have done so much good together. We've done it together. We couldn't have done it without you, and we've done so much. From the biggest tax cuts in history, to regulation cuts. The biggest ever. We have cut regulations at a level that nobody believes.",Donald Trump
"It would take 18 to 20 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to two, it will soon be down to one. And it may not get approved. It may be an environmental problem, it may be a safety problem, but it shouldn't take 20 years, 19 years, one and -- 21 years. And by the time you get it approved it's -- First of all, you start out as a young man on a highway project -- and you end up in retirement.",Donald Trump
"And then you get a rejection. We rejected three to two some board somewhere. No, we've done a great job. And, uh, we rebuilt our military. We just got a 91% approval from our veterans. Our veterans just gave us a 91% percent approval. Highest we've ever got. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect your second amendment, which is gone if sleepy Joe Biden gets -- Defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly made with that beautiful, beautiful phrase, right?",Donald Trump
"Made in the U.S.A. Next year, we will be -- And I mean this. I think we're, we have such a foundation -- This group over here. They're a, they're an activist group. Thank you very much. Thank you fellows. [Audience chants ""USA""] It's a great group. Thank you. Thank you very much, we appreciate it.",Donald Trump
"Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country.So you had the -- Last year was the best year you ever had. Before that was the best year. You had three of them with me, and then we got hit with the, uh, the plague. And then we went back to work. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1% last week.",Donald Trump
"And if you look at the auto business, auto business, I don't know what's going on. It's, it's at a level that it's never been at. What is that all about? What is that all about. You wouldn't think. And this is during a pandemic. We're rounding the turn, by the way. We're roun -- They hate it when I say it.",Donald Trump
"But we're rounding the turn. You know, they used to say, ""Look at the way Europe's doing."" Well, take a look at Europe, take a look. And what we've done in terms of the economy, we went down less than any major country in the world. Or any country. And now we've gone up far faster, and far higher than any country in the world, it's not even close.",Donald Trump
"And it could be tougher, because of the size. Because we're a big country. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months alone, which is another record. That's another big record. We've never hired that many people that fast. While foreign nations are at a free fall, we're creating an economic powerhouse, unrivaled anywhere in the world.",Donald Trump
"A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago, under Obama and Biden.And if Biden and Kamala -- You don't have to say it. Kamala. Kamala. If Biden and Kamala Harris, who's further left by far than crazy Bernie Sanders, right? He's considered a strict conservative compared to her.How the hell did he ever pick her, Mike?",Donald Trump
"Where is Mike? How did that ever happen? That turned out -- I don't think that's going to be a good pick. You're going to find out tomorrow. By the way, she happens to be slightly against fracking. She's still against fracking, you know? Isn't that amazing? Isn't that amazing? Biden goes like, ""I'm against -- ."" For a year and a half, you know he's running, running.",Donald Trump
"Nobody gave him a chance because he never got more than 1% in prime time, right? 25 years ago, the guy never got 1%. And you know, he never had what it took. He was a glad hander. Not a smart guy. Not a nice guy, either. By the way, not a nice guy. But he was -- I used to call him 1% Joe because he ran for president all the time and he never got more than 1%. Now he's got half the intelligence he had 20 years ago and he wins.",Donald Trump
"Politics is a strange business, Isn't it? Strange, very strange business. But if Biden and Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a very steep depression. That's what's going to happen. This the only man that I've ever seen run for office on the fact that he wants to give you the largest tax increase in the history Of our country.",Donald Trump
"No, that's just, that's his space. He doesn't -- The good news is he has no idea what the hell he's saying, so the -- He goes up, here's his line, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give you the biggest tax crease, increase in the history of our country. It will be $4 trillion."" They're going to increase your taxes by $4 trillion. $4 trillion tax increase, that's his campaign.",Donald Trump
"We gonna -- And they're going to put the money in the green new deal, Which is conceived and dedigna -- designated by AOC plus three, right? AOC plus three. This was their deal. I don't think they ever took an environmental course. Did they go to college by the way? Did -- I don't think they ever took a course on the environment, but Biden wants to raise your taxes $4 trillion, massively increased regulations.",Donald Trump
"You know, the regulations may have been more important than even the big tax cuts that you got, the biggest ever. You got the biggest tax cuts ever, and you know it, you know it. You felt that in a very, very good place. you know where it is? Your wallet. You felt it in your wallet. They wanted to close down your factories, send your jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs.",Donald Trump
"Women of the suburbs, please. Okay. Please. I wiped out a regulation that would have destroyed your home, to put it badly, would have destroyed your American dream. And Ben Carson was a great guy. He said, ""Sir, why don't we just do this? Why don't we just sort of ease it up?"" It's a horrible regulation.",Donald Trump
"What it does is a horrible thing. And everybody knows it. It would have destroyed the suburbs. I said, ""Ben, let's just cut it out. Let's terminate it because there's no negotiating. Hear, let's just terminate it."" And I terminated it. And you know, one thing I know about the women of the suburbs, they want two things; they want their home, they want their family that, but they want safety and they want security.",Donald Trump
"And that's what we provide. And I think this will be like four years ago. Remember? ""Donald Trump will do very poorly with women at the end of the evening when they're all crying."" And I remember they would cry. I remember Martha Raddatz, oh, oh, oh. She's very impartial. She was another one of my debate anchors.",Donald Trump
"I had some real beauties, didn't they? She was, she was crying and they all said we're going to do badly with women. I'm going to get terribly with women. I, I said, ""Why? What's so bad? Tell me what's so bad?"" And at the end of the evening, he's done very well with women. What happened now? But this time we're going to do even better because we are providing safety and security.",Donald Trump
"And we -- And for the suburban women, I mean, we, we're saving the suburbs. This regulation was so horrible. What it does to the suburbs, it would have destroyed the suburbs as we do them. And, you know, I just want to -- I gotta say this, 31% of the people living and moving to the suburbs are minority groups, African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American.",Donald Trump
"They have a great American dream also. And they want to live in the suburbs and they want to be proud and they don't want to live next to do a project that somebody puts in because they play games with the zoning and other things. And all I can say is for the women, I don't even talk about the men in the suburbs.",Donald Trump
"I don't care about the men of the suburbs. I only care -- Because they're all saying, ""He's going, no, what about us?"" I don't worry about you. But the women of the suburbs are going to vote for President Trump because we love you and we're saving you a horrible, a horrible thing was going to happen, frankly.",Donald Trump
"And it's been happening for years and it has been a very bad situation, So we solved it. We terminated it. It's gone. Now, if they get in, if they should get in, uh, you can take that regulation and quadruple it just like they want to quadruple your taxes. You can quadruple it. So, I think that'll be good.",Donald Trump
"I think we're going to have a great moments. That's a pretty hard pitch, but that's the way it is, man. They want to dissolve your borders. You know, we complete the wall in a very short period of time. We're over 400 miles.Over 400 miles, and that's right. Mexico is paying for the wall. You know, they like to say Mexico's -- But we, we will have the wall completed very shortly.",Donald Trump
"We're over 400 miles right now. 400 miles. And we're building 10 miles a week. And we now have the strongest numbers, and the strongest borders, southern border that we've ever had. And you know what? We want people to come into our country. But they have to come in legally, and they have to come in through merit.",Donald Trump
"We want people that can help us. We want people that can help us. They want to terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare, 400 -- Think of this. Think of this. Private healthcare. You work so hard. You have 180 million people that have a great healthcare plan and love it. Private plans. And they want to end it, and put you on socialized medicine.",Donald Trump
"I don't think so. [Audience boos] I don't think you'll be -- I don't think you're going to be too happy. I don't think you -- We have a cold, let's go to the hospital, and let's wait for nine days to see a doctor. They want to confiscate your guns, second amendment. [Audience boos] And indoctrinate your children with hateful anti-American lies. [Audience boos] So you'll be happy that I just signed on the plane -- It's beautiful, Air Force One, and it is a beauty, I have to admit -- An executive order to teach our nation's students pro American values [Crosstalk]. Sleepy Joe Biden has vowed to abolish and eradicate the American oil and natural gas industries.",Donald Trump
"And he's pledged to ban fracking. And you saw that for a year. [Audience boos] More than that. He'd get on stage with all these crazy people, radical left people. And they were screaming. Who could ban it faster. He would say, ""Yes, I'd ban fracking. I am totally against fracking."" For a year, ""I am against fracking."" Y -- I could play a hundred clips.",Donald Trump
"See the board? Where is the board. I spent a lot of money for that today. I could -- He'd go for a year. ""I am against fracking."" Then he lucks out, because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren doesn't get out. So she takes enough worts -- Uh, she takes votes away from crazy Bernie, right? On Super Tuesday. And he loses by a little bit on each state, and Bernie loses again.",Donald Trump
"This poor guy, crazy Bernie. But he's running again in four years, don't worry about it. No, he's the best loser I've ever seen. Y -- He can lose. He lost with Hillary. Didn't -- They didn't treat him too well. And then he lost. But Elizabeth Warren lost it. If she would have gotten out, he would have had the votes, he would have won easily.",Donald Trump
"So instead of, uh, crazy Bernie, I voted -- I'm running against, uh, sleepy guy, right? I'm running against a very sleepy guy. We can't let the sleepy guy fool us though, because he happens to be a corrupt politician, and they don't want to write it. Biden's energy plan will send every state into a crushing poverty situation, from Michigan to Minnesota.",Donald Trump
"We're going to win Minnesota, because of Omar and because we did a great job in stopping the riots in Minneapolis. The National Guard went in. They could have called them a lot sooner. Like a week and a half. You wouldn't have had half your city burnt down. But Arizona, Pennsylvania. We're doing great in Pennsylvania, by the way.",Donald Trump
"I just got the word. I just got the word. We're doing great in Pennsylvania. It's looking good. It's act -- I think you're going to have a very exciting -- You're going to have a very exciting evening, or day tomorrow. But evening in particular tomorrow. You know when people see it -- I walk in. We do polls.",Donald Trump
"And they do a poll. ""We interviewed 73 people."" ""And President Trump is down 57 points."" This is a poll. See this is a poll. When you draw crowds like this -- This is not the crowd of somebody that's going to lose the State of Michigan. This is not, this is not -- And look at this drive -- You can't even see the end of it.",Donald Trump
"You can't e -- This is not the crowd of a second place finisher. Do you agree with that? No. No. This is our crowd. All together. We're in this together. And we're doing it together. As long as I'm president, we'll remain -- We will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on this planet.",Donald Trump
"And for the first time, we are energy independent. You never heard that term before. We're energy independent. And you know, we have good relationships in different parts of the world, and some we help. We don't have to, though. Now we don't have to do. We do what we want, but we have some very good allies and partners, and we'll help them.",Donald Trump
"But we don't need their oil anymore. We have so much oil. We have more oil than anybody, okay? And it's, uh, an incredible thing that have -- it's happened over the last few years, a lot of great things, and you're paying what, $2 a gallon for your gasoline? That's okay. You know what that's like? That's like a tax cut.",Donald Trump
"That's bigger than a tax cut. If Biden got in, you'd be paying $7, $8, $9, then they'll say, ""Get rid of your car."" [Audience boos] ""We're gonna get some more windmills. Kill all the birds."" Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificiing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of, okay?",Donald Trump
"A vote for Biden is a vote to eradicate your auto industry. Somehow I don't think you wanna do that in your particular state. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made, and now we have USMCA-- which is a great deal. What a difference. Now you were sending all your jobs. You know, 12 years ago, I was honored, believe it or not, the Man of the Year.",Donald Trump
"I was never thinking about doing this. The Man of the Year in Michigan. I'm still trying to figure out how that happened, but -- and I got up and I said, ""You know, you're losing all your car business to Mexico, and Canada, too, by the way. And what are you doing? Why are you doing it?"" And it was a whole big thing, became quite controversial, as usual, but I was right, and it was probably the biggest reason that I ultimately ran for the presidency because I saw how we were being ripped off, not only in the auto business, how we were being ripped off by every country of the world, friend and foe, on trade, and it just was something that was terrible.",Donald Trump
"Now we're the USMCA. They said there's no way I'd ever pull it off. There's no way you'd get rid of NAFTA. You know why? Because Mexico and Canada loved it. I said, ""Well, if they love it, that means it can't be any good, right?"" They said, ""Aw, we never thought of that one."" So I wouldn't say they're exactly thrilled with USMCA, but we're fine with it.",Donald Trump
"We like it. But it was sending your auto jobs, so many of 'em, to Mexico and it was, uh, terrible. Uh, Joe Biden supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which was the beginning of a disaster. It was good for China, but it was sure as hell bad for us. But, you know, we won $7 1/2 billion a little while ago because we wouldn't win anything.",Donald Trump
"They had no respect for this country whatsoever. And now they know that if they don't treat us right, we'll pull out of that deal so fast. Now all of a sudden we're winning all these cases, but we just won $7 1/2 billion, which would have been impossible with a different president. You are so lucky I've agreed to be your president.",Donald Trump
"Go out and vote for Trump. The $7 1/2 billion we won, that was nice. Michigan lost half of all of its auto manufacturing jobs because that was like a Biden and his friends, that was a betrayal to you and to many other states. He supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have eliminated your auto industry totally.",Donald Trump
"I came in and immediately canceled it. I was so happy to cancel it. TPP. I ended the NAFTA disaster. Canceled that one, too. I've been an activist, depsite the fact that every week, I've been hit at all different sides. Let's impeach him for having a perfect conversation with the President of Ukraine. [Audience boos]They were the ones that had the bad conversations, including your son making a $183,000 a month to sit on the board of a company. [Audience boos] His son.",Donald Trump
"Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? His first name is ""Where?"" Where's Hunter? Remember that? I brought that up. A t-shirt was made overnight. It was the hottest selling t-shirt of the year. Where's Hunter? You know where Hunter is? He's buying vacuum cleaners, 'cause he follows his father, and he takes -- He vacuums in money from every country that his father sees.",Donald Trump
"No, seriously, Ukraine. His father was in charge of Russia, Ukraine, and China. President Obama entrusted him with those three countries. Those are three beauties, right? Russia, Ukraine. So Russia, Moscow, the mayor of Moscow's wife, gives him $3 1/2 million, Hunter. Now he got, you know, dismissed from the military, was unemployed.",Donald Trump
"His father becomes Vice President, and now all of a suden he's raking in money like you never saw. Now you tell me, is that honest? And then they say, ""The Big Guy gets 10%. The Big Guy, in some cases, gets 15%. And then the last one they asked China for $10 million here. This is, This is Biden. They asked for $10 million here, $10 million, for introductory purposes.",Donald Trump
"That's right, introductory purposes. In other words, he's gonna introduce people to who? To his father, for which he gets $10 million a year. I never saw anything like this, and the Fake News refuses to report it because they don't want it in there, because it's not good for them. [Audience boos] But how about the Moscow? $3 1/2 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. $3 1/2 million to Where's Hunter?",Donald Trump
"You know where -- where's Hunter? He's at the bank depositing his money.No, think of it. So he gets a billion and a half from China. He goes with his father on Air Force Two, a plane that the great Vice President Mike Pence uses, too. Mike, do your kids follow you to the various countries, raking in money?",Donald Trump
"No, he's got the greatest people, the greatest children, the greatest family. I don't think they have, right, with their flying airplanes for our military. No, they don't -- They do it a little differently. They do it the old-fashioned way. Now, Mike Pence, it's a whole d -- I always compare. I say, can you imagine with Mike Pence, how good we have it with Mike Pence compared to that?",Donald Trump
"Right? Now, it's so great. Now how about the China, though? So the kid has no investment experience whatsoever. His father and him, they go in the Air Force Two. In 10 minutes, like a 10-minute meeting, he walks out with a billion and a half dollars from China. They don't do this for the biggest investment firms.",Donald Trump
"I spoke to a friend of mine. He's one of the biggest guys in Wall Street. He said, ""No, this is never done. They invest their own money. They don't need people that are much dumber than them to invest their money. They invest their own money. They don't do that."" They said, ""Wow, that's amazing. How long did it take 'em to get the money?"" About 10 minutes.",Donald Trump
"Walks out with a billion and a half dollars to invest, which is millions of dollars a year, and the Fake News and Big Tech -- You know, Big Tech is getting very dangerous, very dangerous. But it's one of the reasons we have to win. They have me trending every day on Twitter, trending. They make up these stories, phony stories.",Donald Trump
"They put up stories. Or they'll take an old story, make it as bad. Number one trend, like some really boring story, you know? Trending is like, gotta be cool, right, to trend? I'm trending number one, number two, number three. Every one negative, negative, negative. How the hell did I ever win this thing?",Donald Trump
"It's such a fix with these people. I'm always trending with these stories that are like, either they didn't happen, or they make 'em different? And it's not -- I don't wanna act like a complainer, but it's a totally rigged deal. And everyone said -- Four year ago, they said, ""Sir, you can't win."" Why? ""Because Big Tech is against you."" I said, ""What's Big Tech?"" I didn't even know what the hell it was, right?I learned fast because I think we're number one in the world now in social.",Donald Trump
"So we learned very well. We got a lot of people. You know what? If I didn't have -- They say, ""Don't tweet."" Forget tweet. It's called social media. If we didn't have social media, I'd have no voice. We wouldn't be here. I have no choice. They say, ""Gee, we wish he wouldn't do so much tweeting."" I, I don't do tweeting.",Donald Trump
"What I do is social media, and without it, I don't think we'd be here, 'cause we'd have no voice. There's no voice with these people. They're dishonest people, mostly, not in all cases. [Audience boos]But Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who, what he's done is, uh, he's bled America dry. In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as President who is finally putting America first.",Donald Trump
"And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because, thank you, I'm not a politician. Thank you very much. 'Cause I don't always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment. It's because I was elected to fight for you, and I fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.",Donald Trump
"Joe Biden is bought and paid for by Big Tech, Big Media, and powerful special interest. That's why he takes in $300 million. They take in millions and millions of dollars for his crazy campaign, and he's not gonna win. I really don't believe he's gonna win, because of this. Take a look. This is going on all over the country.",Donald Trump
"They have tractors, thousands of tractors. You ever see this? Thousands in Iowa. They have thou -- We're winning in Iowa, very big, by the way, just in case. Thousands of tractors in Iowa on big farms, thousands of those. They have thousands of boats, 6,000 boats out in the lake, out in the ocean, they have things, nobody's ever seen anything like it.",Donald Trump
"So I think we're going to have a very big day. But they say you can't win without big tech. Well, we're going to find out tomorrow. Wouldn't that be wonderful? But they said the same thing, they said the same thing four years ago. I said I thought, you know -- The head of CNN said, ""You can't win without CNN."" I said, ""Really?"" And we won.",Donald Trump
"So now we have to do it again. They're totally crooked. They're fake news. CNN is fake. CNN and the others are fake news. They own Biden. They control him and they know that he will always do their bidding. Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you is supporting Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disasters, foreign wars that hurt our country so badly and hurt our young people so badly, they support sleepy Joe Biden.",Donald Trump
"The career politicians that off-shored your industries and decimated your factories and sent your jobs away, they support Biden. The open border lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs and gangs and crime, they support Biden. The far left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police and demeaned your sacred faith and values, they support Biden.",Donald Trump
"The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage and heroes, they support sleepy Joe Biden. Antifa and the rioters, looters, Marxists and left-wing extremists, they all support Biden. This election comes down to a very simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfish political maniacs that you're dealing with?",Donald Trump
"Or do you want to be ruled by the American people? You're supposed to be ruled by the American people. You want to be represented by a career politician who hates you, by an outsider? I mean just take a look. These people, what they do and what they get away with, and I guess that's the other reason. I mean I was in politics and I see what -- what's been happening to our country.",Donald Trump
"Our country was going to hell and we've turned it. And we got -- we got waylaid by this plague that came in, but we've done a job like nobody else has ever done a job and you understand it. And that's why there's so many of you here tonight and that's why all over the country, this is happening, all over the country.",Donald Trump
"And even, they're just springing up by themselves. I'm not there. I don't do this. I mean it's you look, they had something today I read where a hundred miles of cars all with the flag, the American flag, the Trump, the whole Trump thing. But you want to be represented by a career politician who actually doesn't like you or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before is what I'm doing.",Donald Trump
"And it's not easy, but there's nothing I've ever enjoyed more in my life because we are making so much progress. We have to now finish the progress. A vote for Biden is a vote to hand the keys of government over to people who don't like you, don't respect you, and who want to rob your children of their American dream.",Donald Trump
"We have a great American dream. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let that happen. We're going to keep our great American dream. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists and communists and socialists and wealthy liberal hypocrites, and all of those that want to silence, censor, cancel, and punish you.",Donald Trump
"If you want your children to be safe and you want your values to be honored, if you want your life to be treated with dignity and respect, then I am asking you to go to the poll tomorrow and vote, vote, vote. Remember what I said four years ago? I am your voice and we will make America great again, And that's why we're here.",Donald Trump
"For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me and to stop you because they know I don't answer to them. I answer to you, that's why we're here. That's why we're here. Together, we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class and we will drain the Washington swamp, and we will save that American dream, that beautiful, beautiful American dream.",Donald Trump
"This election is a choice between a deadly [Inaudible] lockdown, open up your state, Governor, or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic, and leads to the greatest economy in the history of the world. That's where we're going. We were there, and we're going to get it back very quickly, and that's going to bring our whole country together, because success brings it together.",Donald Trump
"And, it was happening. Before that plague came in, it was happening. People were calling me that you would least suspect, and it was all happening, and then we had to close it down, and now build it up, and it's building -- It's not a V. It's a super V. It's a super V. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks.",Donald Trump
"It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. And, with or without the vaccine, great companies, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, but, with or without it, we are rounding the turn. Just remember that. You know, they don't like it. They hate it when I say that. We're rounding the turn.",Donald Trump
"And, they always use Europe. ""Oh, look at Europe. Look at Europe."" Well, take a look at Europe. Look at how they're doing, and their economy is in tatters, and they have a lot of problems, and we don't want that. We don't want that, and that should've never happened. Should've never happened. That should've never been allowed to happen.",Donald Trump
"Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state, looking -- [Audience boos]He's looking you in the face, and he's locking you in your home while letting rioters, ANTIFA, the radical left run down your streets, riot in your streets, burn down your stores, beat you over the head, and they're allowed to do that, but you can't go to your church, you can't have dinner with your family, but you're allowed to protest and riot.",Donald Trump
"That's why I call of these protests, because we're allowed to protest. You're not allowed to meet and you're not allowed to pray together, but you're allowed to protest, so I call everything that we do a protest. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmas, no Fourth of July, no future for the youth.",Donald Trump
"Other than that, it's actually quite good. A vote for sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, and misery. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus -- By the way, he would've been so far behind on a vaccine. He would've been so far behind. He did the swine flu. It was the joke of -- They didn't know what the hell they were doing.",Donald Trump
"Now, he's saying, ""He should've acted faster,"" except, when I did the ban on China, he said I shouldn't do it for two and a half months, then he admitted he was wrong too. Then, he runs it. Now, he's saying I should've acted -- I was so early in doing that ban, and we saved -- And, our biggest critic admits that we saved thousands and thousands of lives by doing it.",Donald Trump
"Thousands of lives, and the ventilators that we've made and all of the things that we've done, and the -- All of the, uh, medicines that are coming out, and here I am, right? Here I am. I'm sure it had nothing to do with the medicine. I used to sort of give the medicine a little bit of credit. Now, I give it none, because I'm a perfect physical specimen and I'm a very -- I'm a very young person.",Donald Trump
"I'm a very young person. I said that, you know, of course, a little bit sarcastically. I said it a couple of weeks ago. I said, ""No, no, I'm better -- perfect."" I mean, it was very quick, very easy, because I'm in perfect physical shape, and I'm a very young man. CNN went crazy. ""He is not in great shape, and he is not a young -- "" They went totally crazy.",Donald Trump
"They are definitely seriously losers. Could you imagine if they had to cover sleepy Joe for four years? Their ratings would tank. You know, they have the highest -- All these tel -- That's why football is not doing well. First of all, they're not going to do well. Basketball was down 71%, right? Their finals.",Donald Trump
"You know why? Because our people want to see people that respect our country, respect our anthem, and respect our flag. And, football's way down, but you know, they're down for that reason, but they're also down because people would rather watch this stuff than watch football, because this is much tougher.",Donald Trump
"They consider this to be much tougher, actually, but can you imagine if they covered sleepy Joe? The ratings are phenomenal for all these things, and then they cover sleepy Joe. Their ratings would tank. They would come to see me, ""Sir, I think it's really important that you run again. You're going to -- Because we are losing our networks.",Donald Trump
"Our ratings are down the tubes."" The failing New York Times will definitely be out of business very quickly. They used to write nothing about me. Now, I average, probably about four or five stories a day, the front page. Someday they're gonna give me a good one. Watch.It might be tomorrow. We gotta have a big win.",Donald Trump
"We want a big win, not just a win. We want a big -- We want a big one. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said about Biden that he was wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy in national security issue over the past four decades. He's been wrong on everything. He's been wrong on everything. But don't believe me, because you're Michigan.",Donald Trump
"I spent all of these funds on these beautiful, very large television sets. I call 'em beautiful large screens. They're large television sets. Let's see it for yourself, okay? Go ahead. [Video Begins]",Donald Trump
They'd look at it. So I learned about roaches.,Donald Trump
"Look, exacerbating the need for ""exodmental"" -- for exod -- for environmental justice.",Donald Trump
"It puts much more pressure on me running against a guy like this, you know? You know, you lost to somebody that was good. Can you imagine if -- The concept of losing to this guy? Oh, you better, you better get out there and vote tomorrow. I will be so angry. I'll never come back to Michigan. I'll never come back.",Donald Trump
"I'll tell Japan to bring all those plants there, all back. Joining us tonight are some great warriors, great people, Congressman Huizenga. Bill? Where is Bill? Thank you. Thank you very much. Everything good? You're doing great. Thank you, Bill. Congressional candidate Peter Meijer. Peter? Where's Peter?",Donald Trump
"Peter? Where's Peter? Peter, you don't have a good location. What happened to Peter? Peter's here someplace, and I hear he's doing great. House Speaker Lee Chatfield. Lee? Thank you, Lee. Great job you're doing. RNC Chair, she got me -- I'll tell you, what a job she did. What a job she did. Ronna McDaniel.",Donald Trump
"Where are you, Ronna? What a job she's done. She, uh, you know, we won, we won this great, we won this great state with her leadership. Thank you, Ronna, very much. Great job. State GOP Chair Laura Cox. Laura? Good job. Are we gonna win? Okay, good. Otherwise, we will fire you so fast. No. We're gonna -- I think we're gonna have a tremendous victory in Michigan.",Donald Trump
"I think we're gonna have a tremendous victory in all of these states they're talking about. I see all of them, maybe. We're gonna have a tremendous evening. I, I hope so. For the good of our country, I hope so. You see the alternative. I'm sorry. But this is not just an alternative. We're doing a great job, but we wanna keep it going, okay?",Donald Trump
"We wanna keep it going, and we're going to. A very special person, Medal of Honor recipient, Jim McCloughan. Jim, where are you? Great job. He's a very brave one. Thank you very much, Jim. Congratulations. That's a great honor, our highest honor. Ted Nugent, and he is, he is great. Where is Ted? Great job, Ted.",Donald Trump
"He's been from day one, right, Ted? Great job. Thank you very much for everything. We appreciate it. I love, I love your sound. I love your music. And speaking of sound, music, and other things, one of the big superstars of the world, Lil' Pimp. There he is. How's it going? You wanna come up and say something?",Donald Trump
Come on. Lil' Pump. Come on. Come on up here. Come on up here. Does everyone know who he is? You know how big he is? Come on up here. (laughs) It's a nice hat. Come on. Say something.,Donald Trump
"Hello, everybody. How you all fe -- How you guys feeling? I come here to say, Mr. President, I appreciate everything you've done for our country. You've brought the troops home, and you're doing the right thing. MAGA 20, 2020. Don't forget that! Don't forget that and do not vote for sleepy Joe at all.",Donald Trump
"Thank you. That's great. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. That's very nice. Big star, big star. (Laughs) That's very impressive. For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young black men super predators. To every black American, I am asking you to get out tomorrow and vote.",Donald Trump
"This is your one and only chance -- Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you very much. To show Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you, to betray you, and I'm fighting for you. And you know what we've done. What we've done is really something that nobody thought could've happened.",Donald Trump
"Other administrations, in particular, the last administration didn't make even a move to try and get it done. We got criminal justice reform done. We got prison reform done. We got opportunity zones all done and complete. [Inaudible]. We had funding for historically black colleges and universities completed and done, and it's an honor to have done it.",Donald Trump
"And I say it all the time, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, no president has done as much for the black community as President Trump, and I'm very proud of it, very proud of it. Thank you. Thank you. And it's been an honor. It's been an honor. Biden has vowed to increase refugee admissions from terrorist nations by over 700%, including from Syria, Somalia and Yemen.",Donald Trump
"The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the entire Midwest into a virtual refugee camp. I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists, if you don't mind, the hell out of our country, okay. And if you take a look at France over the last week, they're having a devastating problem.",Donald Trump
"Another problem happened today, a very big problem in Europe, and we don't want it. We don't want that problem. We don't need it. We don't want it. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military, biggest investment we've ever made. We are the envy of every country militarily. Russia, China, North Korea, everybody looks at what we have.",Donald Trump
"Nobody -- Tanks, F35s and super fighter jets, tankers, submarines, missiles, rockets, hypersonic missiles, they go seven times faster than a fastest missile, fastest in the world, all of the things we've done, and our nuclear plants and our nuclear capabilities now at the highest level and it's all in tippy-top shape.",Donald Trump
"And you just have to pray to God that we never use. That's all we say. Pray to God that we never use it. So we have the best, the best in the world. All, by the way, made in the USA and made, a lot of it made right here in Michigan. A lot of it made right here in Michigan. We also passed VA, Veteran's Choice and Veteran's Accountability, VA Accountability with 91%. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi.",Donald Trump
"We eliminated the world's top terrorist. Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been working on that for 52 years. And instead of endless wars, we are now forging peace in the Middle East and we're getting it done.",Donald Trump
"It's going to happen very quickly, you watch. A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream and remember, Abraham Lincoln was a proud member of the Republican party, Abraham Lincoln. In conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world.",Donald Trump
"And we will end our reliance on China once and for all, which is already taking place. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God's help we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment, which is under siege but it's 100% secure with us in this position.",Donald Trump
"Mike, right? We will never touch it. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peach through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which goes into effet on January 1st, bigger than health care, lower drug prices even more. We have signed and done something that's never been done on prescription drug prices, favored nations, it will bring drug prices down 50, 60, 70% like you've never seen before.",Donald Trump
"And the drug companies, Big Pharma, does not exactly like your favorite president, I will tell you, but that's okay. We broke a lock jam. Favorite nations, nobody thought we'd ever do that, we did. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, that's starting very soon.",Donald Trump
"We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust."" For years, you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the great people of Michigan.",Donald Trump
"Tomorrow you have the power, with the power of your vote, right? The power of your vote, but you have a power to safe America for -- This country will never be a socialist nation. We will never allow that to happen. Together we can finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. Nobody knew it was so deep and so vicious, but we have done some job.",Donald Trump
"So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. Most important election perhaps in the history of our country. I never thought I'd say that after what we went through four years ago, I said, ""There'll never be anything like that."" Never be anything like what we went through and, uh, this is the most important election maybe in the history of our country.",Donald Trump
"From Midland to Mackinaw, from Pontiac to Battle Creek, and from Detroit to right here in Grand Rapids, I love Grand Rapids. We inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country, our families, and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world.",Donald Trump
"And the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you, who helped build this country, together we will take back our country. We are taking it back at a level that nobody has believed. We are taking it back and we are winning and we're gonna win tomorrow. We are returning power to you, the American people.",Donald Trump
"With your help, your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Michigan, we have made America powerful again.",Donald Trump
"And our military, it's never been like this.",Donald Trump
"We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America -- great again. Thank you, Michigan.",Donald Trump
Go out and vote. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.,Donald Trump
"Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. This does not look like a second place finish. I saw sleepy Joe, he had about 12 people and unable to fill up his circles. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] Thank you. Thank you very much. Ah, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump
"We love Pennsylvania. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. This is a nice rowdy crowd, isn't it? Huh? Only in Pennsylvania, you know, uh, we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole deal, you know that right? Just like last time. We want to have the same result as we had last time. Hello Scranton.",Donald Trump
"Hello Pennsylvania. Thank you very much. Tomorrow we are going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we are going to win four more years in the White House. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our magnificent military, protect your second amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. [Audience member calls out ""Made in the USA""] Right?",Donald Trump
"More and more. [Audience chants ""USA""] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Remember last time they said, ""No, no, Pennsylvania hasn't been won by a Republican for many, many years. Many, many years."" And then we won and it wasn't even close when you get right down to it. [Audience chants ""We love you.""] Thank you very much.",Donald Trump
"Thank you. That's really nice. Don't make me cry. I'll cry with that whole thing. I'll cry and then they'll have it onto -- They'll say, ""The president broke down and cried in front of his fans."" I dunno. Hey, maybe that would lift you up, right? You pick up 10 points for crying. I say I still don't want to do it.",Donald Trump
"Thank you very much. No, it's really nice. Thank you. Nobody's ever heard that chant before you know, it's never a chant that anybody's ever heard in a political way. Like Ronald Reagan, or like people, but nobody's ever heard of that chant and we appreciate it. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country.",Donald Trump
"We have the foundations already done. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, last Friday it was released, 33.1% the fastest. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months, while foreign nations are in a free fall, and you see what's happening all over the world.",Donald Trump
"We are creating an economic powerhouse, unrivaled anywhere in the world. We went down less, and we've gone up much more. Nobody close. A recent Gallop poll found that 56 percent of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago. If Biden and Kamala, you know Kamala, right? Kamala.",Donald Trump
"Remember, it's the Harris/Biden administration, when he said that. ""The Harris/Biden-"" No, no, Joe, you're supposed to go first, Joe. But Harris, and the radical left, and she is radical left. She's further than I guess you could say Bernie is a conservative by comparison, right? No, she's the most far left.",Donald Trump
"The radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send Pennsylvania into a steep depression. Don't worry about it, it's not gonna happen. I don't think it's gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. We're gonna win. We've got some big surprises. Oh, look at, look at all of the fake news. Look at all of the fake news.",Donald Trump
"David! Turn the mike up. Up. Turn the mike up. Biden will raise your taxes four trillion dollars, massively increasing your regulations, they're going to increase your regulations. Maybe more important than the tax cuts. We gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and maybe more importantly, we did regulation cuts which were also the biggest in the history of our country.",Donald Trump
"Whether it be four years, eight years, or in one case, more. Shut down your economy, close down manufacturers, send your jobs overseas, destroy our suburbs, and he will destroy our suburbs, so I say to the women of the suburbs, ""Love me, women of the suburbs, love me."" I terminated, I terminated the regulation.",Donald Trump
"Dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare. 180 million people. Outlaw. You're going to have socialized medicine, that's what they're going to have. Somehow, I don't see Pennsylvania liking that too much. Confiscate your guns, 2nd Amendment in big trouble. And indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies.",Donald Trump
"I just signed an executive order to teach your students pro-American values. Biden has vowed to abolish, extinguish, and eradicate American oil. All fracking and natural gas. And you know, I say this because we'll give it an extra little time. This is Pennsylvania, this is a state that's a wonderful state.",Donald Trump
"I went to school here, I went to college here, and I'll tell you what, and I know it well, a big part of your livelihood, or your money, your income, your low taxes, is fracking. He's spent over a year saying he will not allow fracking. The first time he came into Pennsylvania as the nominee, which was a shock to everybody.",Donald Trump
"Everybody, all Elizabeths, Pocahontas, Warren [Inaudible]. Leave two days early, and it would have been crazy Bernie instead of sleepy Joe. I would have had a crazy guy instead of a sleepy guy, but he came in and after going for one year, and she, forget her, she still can't say it, she can't say it, but he said, ""No, we will ban fracking.",Donald Trump
"We will ban fracking."" That's what he said, many, many times. Once he got the nomination, he came to Pennsylvania, they said, ""You're gonna have to do something, because you have a million jobs, and it's a massive part of your wealth."" So he walked in and he went from, ""We will ban fracking,"" to, ""Of course, we can have fracking.",Donald Trump
"What's the problem?"" Just remember this, it's always -- Yeah, that's right. He said play the video. You know, I might not have that one on the video today. But, you know, he immediately changed, and the fake news, the fake news -- Where is Hunter? Where is? Where's Hunter? Hunter's at a foreign country, taking in 25 million today.",Donald Trump
"He's at a country that his father just left, picking up about 25 million. No, that's total corruption. But he went out, he went out, and he started talking about fracking, and he said, ""We will absolutely allow you, but not on government land."" You know, not on government. And the press never held him accountable, and they never held him accountable for all of the corruption that he's a part of.",Donald Trump
"Biden's plan to ban fracking is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. Biden's energy shutdown will wipe out your jobs, decimate your towns, eliminate your factories, and send your state into a nightmare of crippling poverty. You've been there. You've been there. You had the best three years that you ever had under President Trump.",Donald Trump
"The best three years. And next year will be the best of all. Watch. You see it happening. If you look at housing [Inaudible], you look at automobile manufacturing, you're going to have your best year next year, unless somebody decides to come along and quadruple your taxes, then you're going downhill, which is what he's going to do.",Donald Trump
"A vote for Biden is a vote to ban fracking, outlaw mining, explode energy costs, and totally destroy Pennsylvania. You know that, right? It's going to destroy Pennsylvania, and it could happen. It could happen very fast. You take a look at a country. Take a look at Venezuela. Same ideology, and this was unbelievably wealthy, rich country, one of the richest countries, and now they don't have water.",Donald Trump
"They don't have food. They don't have medicine. It's a very sad situation. It can happen here, just much, much bigger, but it can happen here with these maniacs. And you know, it's one of those things. Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure on ridiculous, endless foreign wars.",Donald Trump
"Most of you have never even heard of some of these countries. He shuttered your steel mills. I got them open. I got them open. I -- I tariffed, very nicely tariffed dumped steel. They were dumping steel. China was dumping steel all over the place. You ask the heads of your steel companies, you wouldn't have any steel companies right now.",Donald Trump
"Annihilated your coal jobs and supported every disastrous trade deal for half a century. He was a cheerleader of NAFTA, which was one of the worst trade deals ever made. We have a very good one, thank you. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which lifted China into a great power, great economic power, except they were going to catch us for 10 years if you study.",Donald Trump
"China was going to catch us in 2019. Guess what? We were going so far ahead, and frankly, if you have somebody smart, real smart in this position, they'll never catch you. They will never, ever catch you. But if you study the history, you'll see 10 years ago, 2019, they will catch, and they would have. If I didn't come along, they would have caught you.",Donald Trump
"They would have caught you. And then we had the plague. We built the greatest economy in history, and then we had the plague come in from China, came in. We closed it down, we saved two million lives. We saved two million lives, and nobody gets it. The projection was 2.2 million modeled out. We saved two million lives.",Donald Trump
"We understand the disease, and now we opened it up. And by the way, Pennsylvania, get your state open. Get it open. Terrible. Terrible. Your governor has to open your state, Pennsylvania, has to open your state. Yeah. Get it open. Get it open, governor. Get it open and count the votes honestly, governor.",Donald Trump
"Count them honestly. There was a, uh, very good pollster last night, actually a good one. He has us winning everything, but he was on last night. How are you, how's he going to do in Pennsylvania? He was on a show called Sean Hannity, have you ever heard of it? No, and he said, uh, ""How's he going to do in Pennsylvania?"" He's going to win Pennsylvania, except for the cheating.",Donald Trump
"We figure we have to leave 5% for the cheating that takes care. Can you believe it? For the cheating that takes place in Pennsylvania. And the guy meant it. A very great pollster, but he predicted hewould win the whole election. But the question was, what about Pennsylvania? He said, ""Well, you have to leave 5% for the cheating."" And when the Supreme Court gave you an extension, they made a very dangerous situation.",Donald Trump
"And I mean dangerous, physically dangerous. And they made it a very, very bad -- They did a very bad thing for this state. They did a very bad thing for this nation. You have to have a date. You can't extend dates. The danger that could be caused by that extension and especially when you know what goes on in Philadelphia, and it's been going on for years.",Donald Trump
"So, Governor, open up your state and please don't cheat, Governor. Please don't cheat, 'cause we're all watching. We're all watching you, Governor. We got a lot of -- We have a lot of eyes on the Governor and his friends. A couple of other governors out there, too. Pennsylvania lost half of it's manufacturing jobs after -- [Audience chants ""Drain the swamp""] Thank you.",Donald Trump
"Thanks. So Pennsylvania lost half of your manufacturing jobs. Think of it. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who sold out to Pennsylvania, to China, and also sold out for personal gain and family gain, and where's Hunter? Is Hunter in the crowd? Is Hunter -- Where is Hunter? In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as your president who is finally putting America first.",Donald Trump
"And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. Probably why I'm here. If I don't always play by the rules of Washington or the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you, harder than anyone has ever fought. I will tell you that. Now think of everything we've been through.",Donald Trump
"Look. From before I came to office, from before I came. Whatever. We'll do that in a second. Boy, you are an enthusiastic bunch. You are something. Well, first of all, first of all, you know, you're known as a late voting state. That means you're smart. How about all the thing, #howdoichangemyvote? Did you see that?",Donald Trump
"After the debate, the number one trend was how do we change our vote? That was a debate. Did everybody see the debate? The -- yeah? Yeah. They wanna change their vote. A lot of people on -- Is this a change the vote state? Not so much probably. I don't think your governor would let you do that. No, we have some states, they're changing the votes.",Donald Trump
"And it was started with the debates, and then they see the rallies, the biggest rallies. By the way, and I'll say this to the fake news. In the history, in the history of our country, there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything like this. And this is at a pretty early part of the day.",Donald Trump
"I wouldn't say it's exactly primetime. You outta see last night in Florida. It was amazing. But, but think of this. They, they -- Right from before I even ran, I mean, I, I announced maybe before I announced. They said, ""I hear Trump is -- Oh, let's go in and do it."" But think of it. We were under investigation for three years.",Donald Trump
"And it turned out to be a phony hoax. And it was a phony impeachment. And based on the laptop from hell, the impeachment should have never been. It should have never happened. In fact, it should have happened against the other side 'cause it was the other side that cheated. It was the other side that dealt with Russia.",Donald Trump
"And, but think of it. And then they say, ""President Trump, we don't know if we like his personality. President Trump, he's too rough. He's too tough."" Let me tell you something. If we didn't have a certain type of personality, and if we didn't fight, we wouldn't be here right now because we caught them, we caught them spying on our campaign and trying to take out a duly elected president of the United States.",Donald Trump
And I fought like hell because we don't know any other way. We have to fight. But we caught them and they turned out to be the people that were corrupt. No collusion. They spent $48 million. They found no collusion. They had eighteen angry Democrat prosecutors. I have friends that say there's probably nobody that -- And he was one o -- He is one of the smartest.,Donald Trump
"There's probably nobody that he knows that coulda withstood that. So we had 18 angry, crooked Democrats. You had Bob Mueller that didn't have a clue. You had all of this stuff. Think of it. Think of it. We went through that for two and a half, three years, and then they say, ""Oh, we don't like the way he acted."" We were under siege illegally.",Donald Trump
"Illegally. They committed treason. They tried to take out a duly elected president, and we caught them. We caught them. And then they say -- And then they say -- I see it today. Then they say, ""Oh, wouldn't it be nice-"" And then I say -- I see these guys on televisions and all of the big tech stuff, which is probably worse than them, right?",Donald Trump
"It's the new -- They're the new boss in town, right, not the media. They just shut up, the big tech. And, you know, we gave the power to the big tech, right? We -- But now I say it -- I look at it and I say, ""Gee, they're saying, uh, 'Tough administration, chaos, this -- '"" They created the chaos. All we did was fight back, and we fought back well.",Donald Trump
"And we caught them, and they're all caught, and now let's see what happens, okay? Let's see what happens. But we caught them. It's treason. They spied on our campaign. Nothing like that's ever happened. That's a bigger event -- I would rate Biden second. His family and him took millions and millions and millions of dollars from countries that he deals with.",Donald Trump
"He became vice president. He had a son that didn't have a job. He got thrown out of the military, and he went years with no job. And then he signs with Burisma for $183,000 a month. And then he wanted $3 million up-front payment. ""What's your experience? What do you know about energy?"" ""I don't know anything about energy."" ""Oh, that's okay.",Donald Trump
"We'll put you on the board anyway."" And then he gets -- And then he gets thr -- Then he gets $3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow's wife. 3.5 million. Well, gee, Hunter, what did you do? What did you do? You gave her some big advice, I guess, Hunter, right? And then they go to China, he takes out $1.5 billion to manage, which is millions and millions of dollars a year.",Donald Trump
"And then big one, I guess, we had to -- He had to stop that one because they found the laptop from Hell. But the big one was a request to China to pay them $10 million a year, right, for recommendation services, for services, uh -- For no services. They're -- It's a payoff. Hey, you know what it is? It's a payoff.",Donald Trump
"And the big guy gets 10%. The big guy gets 10%. He's not a big guy. Bum. He's not a big guy. He's a little guy. The big guy gets 10%, and there was another one where the big guy gets 50%, right? But he wanted $10 million a year, and the, and the tech and the media will not -- Wait. The media will not -- This is a very -- This is actually a very big moment in the history of our country because we have freedom of the press, but we don't. We have suppression by the press.",Donald Trump
"It's suppression. And if anybody even mentions that story -- You don't see that story in The New York Times. You don't see -- That is the second biggest scandal in the history of our country. First is that they spied on my campaign. That's the biggest scandal. That's the biggest scandal. And they've got everybody scared, but you have a president that wasn't scared.",Donald Trump
"You have a president that wasn't scared. They said, ""Oh -- "" And I see it. I see it with Twitter trending. I know what trending is better than anybody in the world. I've been trending my whole life. From the day I was born, I've been trending. I know trending. They take a story, they make it worse -- boring story, uh, boring stuff.",Donald Trump
"They'll take something and they'll say, ""Number one trending, Trump this. Number one tr -- "" It's not trending. What trends is stuff that you don't wanna talk about right now. Not having to do with me, either, by the way. Not having to do with me. Look, what we have and what's happened, and you've seen it all over the last two weeks, is a horrible, horrible thing.",Donald Trump
"The media is fake and corrupt. Big tech controls the media, and they control the politicians. And you know what? You have a president that's willing to say it, and it's a very, very big event. And let's say -- And I tell you what, I give Tucker Carlson and I give Sean Hannity and I give Laura -- I give all the people that are willing to talk about it.",Donald Trump
"No, the Tucker reports have been phenomenal. I give all of those people that are willing to talk about, tremendous credit, because people don't have any idea how dangerous this is for our country. They won't even think about -- A guy walks away with millions of dollars. He's vice president, his son's like a human vacuum cleaner.",Donald Trump
"He follows his father and he takes the scraps. But the scraps are hundreds of millions of dollars, and we can't let this happen. We're putting a corrupt man up for possibly being elected. But here's the story. I don't think that's gonna happen. I think we're gonna have a tremendous day tomorrow. Tremendous day.",Donald Trump
"And you know when he announces -- when he announces a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, you know, he said, ""I live in Pennsylvania. I was born in Scranton."" He doesn't say that his father left. And there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that. You know, I went to college in Pennsylvania right, but I don't make the biggest deal of it.",Donald Trump
"But he's, ""I am a man from Scranton. I'm from -- "" He left at nine years old. And that's okay. That's okay. But this guy is a stone cold phony, and -- and honestly, he's not equipped mentally to be your president. He really isn't. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it. I have foreign leaders calling me saying, ""Are they serious?"" I say -- One of them called, said, ""I see that you're down a little bit in a poll."" I said, ""Can you believe this could happen to me?",Donald Trump
"I'd rather run against someone that was good or even outstanding."" Uh, but I think what we're gonna have is one of the great days. You know, when he comes to Scranton and he gives a speech, you saw, he's got the six circles. He can't fill them up. So he said, ""Could you please move over here to the press?"" He puts the press out there.",Donald Trump
"And look at this g -- I don't know how many people are here, but there's a lot of people here. And it's windy as hell, and it's cold, and I couldn't care. I -- look at that flag. Look at that flag. Oh, it's so beautiful. I'd never -- hey look, I'd never seen a -- a flag blow like that. You know what that means?",Donald Trump
"That means it's windy as hell, that's what it means. Wow, look at that. That's on -- that thing's sideways. But it's our American flag, and we love it, right? Yesterday I was thrilled to be endorsed by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. Can -- can you believe it? Pittsburgh Post Gazette, and it's, uh, first time I've ever really liked that paper.",Donald Trump
"And then once you get rid of the first one or two paragraphs, it was great. They said, ""You might not like his tone, you might not like the way -- "" And again, I'm a nice guy. I have to fight -- Wait, I have to fight. I have to fight to protect me and to protect you. Because once I'm not here, there's nobody else to protect you, that I can tell you.",Donald Trump
"But they gave a beautiful -- Uh, you know, I mean, you have to understand everything's relative. They gave a beautiful, beautiful editorial, and I appreciate it. [Audience chants ""We love you""] Thank you. It's the first time -- Thank you. Thank you. I'm telling you, you're gonna make me cry with that, stop.",Donald Trump
"The President broke down in tears as they screamed, ""We love you."" I don't know if President Xi of China wants to hear that. Yeah, he probably would like that. The first time the papers endorsed a Republican for President in over a half a century. So to the people of the Post Gazette, I would like to thank you.",Donald Trump
"I will forgive you for your first one or two or three pparagraphs. Because they said, ""However, he's done a great job."" You know, and I have. I've done a great job. They said, ""Put his personality aside."" But I'm telling you, the assault on this office has changed my personality. I can't -- I -- it's just one of those things.",Donald Trump
"Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media, and powerful specialist interests. They own him, they control him, and they know he will always do their bidding. And you know, when he raises 300 million like last month, I could raise much more than him. I'm President. I could call all these Wall Street guys, most of whom I know.",Donald Trump
"I could call the oil guys, I could call them all. I would be -- I would blow his numbers apart. Give me two hours. As they send me ten million -- No, we don't need it. How many commercials can you buy? You know, we raised -- we raised a lot of money. We raised enough money. You know, crooked Hillary last time outspent us four to one, right?",Donald Trump
"Four to one. And I actually got criticized. They said the other day, ""Even against Hillary Clinton, he didn't raise I -- that much money."" I mean, you won the race, right? They don't care if you won or not. They said -- they always have to find something. But I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time.",Donald Trump
"This is the President of the United States calling for the head of Goldman Sachs. Hello. How are you, Bill? Is everything -- Is everything good? Uh, listen, I'd like $25 million within the next five minutes. Send it to the White House, please."" What, do you think he's gonna say no? Ev -- I would be the greatest.",Donald Trump
"But you know what, I chose not to do that, okay? I chose not to go there, and when you see he raised $300 million, his people are making deals all over the place. Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you, they are supporting sleepy Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars, they support Biden.",Donald Trump
"The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories -- And you got it worse than anybody else, just about. New England was hit hard, too. -- they support Biden. The open-borders lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens and gave them illegal drugs, destroyed our families and so many people, the gangs and crime, they support sleepy Joe Biden.",Donald Trump
"The far-left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police, and demeaned your sacred faith and values, they support Joe Biden. And I see where they wanna defund your, your great Philadelphia police, and you have great police. They wanna -- They wanna defund your Philadelphia police.",Donald Trump
"Have you seen that? They actually wanna defund -- [Audience chants ""Back the blue""] They wanna defund your police. I read it this morning. I don't know. I don't think that's a good idea. I don't think people should take it. You can't take it anymore, right? You can't allow it to happen. And every place we've gone into, within a half an hour, it was over.",Donald Trump
"But they have to ask the federal government. They, they're embarrassed or they're afraid or they think they're gonna lose support. Uh, we wanna go into Portland. We'll settle that in two minutes. We, we were the ones that did the whole thing in Seattle. They -- We told them we're going in the following morning.",Donald Trump
"That night, they raised their hands, they said, ""Well, I think we'll leave now."" They took over a big chunk of Seattle. No, we can't allow this stuff. You look at what's going on in Philadelphia, you look at what's -- That can't be done, and they can't tell the police to stand back. They can't tell [Inaudible]. They stand back and they watch people -- They watch people walk out with washing machines.",Donald Trump
"Guy's pushing a washing machine. That's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. And, you know, the world watches that. They're all Democrat-run cities and states. New York, Chicago, unfortunately Pennsylvania. And many of them are closed, right, because -- You know why they're closed? Because they thought it would hurt our numbers, and then they saw 33.1. That was a big number.",Donald Trump
"The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage, and heroes, they support Joe Biden. Antifa and the rioters and looters and Marxists and left-wing extremists, they all support sleepy Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. And, by the way, just so you understand, 'cause look, Joe -- Joe is, has no clue, okay?",Donald Trump
"Just -- Joe's, Joe's not -- He's not calling the shots. And I guarantee he won't be calling 'em for very long. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you wanna be ruled by the corrupt, selfless political class, or do you wanna be ruled and governed by the American people? Which is what we're doing, which is one the reasons I'm here [Crosstalk]. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist, Communist, Socialist, the wealthy, liberal, hypocrites who wanna silence, censor, cancel, and punish you.",Donald Trump
"If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be respected, if you want to be treated with honor, dignity, and respect, then I am asking you to go tomorrow and vote for Trump. Come on. Well, it's up to you, really. You gotta get out. I'm telling you again. I'll say it again and again.",Donald Trump
"Pennsylvania, I've done very well. You've had your best years ever. Pennsylvania, it's gonna be up to you. It's such a big deal. Big state, everything -- And, and we're doing great in Florida. You know, Florida. It's been great. You notice they're not talking about Florida anymore. Florida's been great.",Donald Trump
"We're doing great in Florida. So, we get Florida, we get Pennsylvania. We're gonna get North Carolina. We're doing great in North Carolina. You saw the poll come out yesterday in Iowa. We're way ahead in Iowa. We're way ahead in Ohio, except we get fake -- sometimes a fake poll. We're way ahead. We won Ohio by eight points.",Donald Trump
"They say we're further up than that this time. Because we have -- everything I talked about, we have done and more. We've done more than I talked about. Remember what I said four years ago. I am your voice and we will make America great again. And that's what we're doing. That's where we're going. For the last four years the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me because they know that I don't answer to them.",Donald Trump
"I answer to you, and it's true. We did this together. You know, this is a movement the likes of which this country, in a way the world probably, but this country has never seen. You know, this country has never seen. You take some of the things that have happened over the many, many years. A politician runs and comes in second in New Hampshire, becomes famous for the rest of his life.",Donald Trump
"We won -- Well, we won everything this time. We won 100% of the states in the primaries, right? But we won 34 states against a crooked person, right? A very crooked person. How crooked is -- By the way, how crooked is Hillary? She deleted 33,000 emails. What's happening with that? But we won, we won, we won like nobody's ever won.",Donald Trump
"Nobody's ever won like we've won. No, no, the likes of which nobody's ever seen anything like it. And, and just to get off that subject for a second, we had, 2016, we had a campaign nobody's ever seen anything like it. Can I be honest? There is much more enthusiasm for this campaign than there was four years ago.",Donald Trump
"Because four years ago I came and I was a successful guy, and I said, ""We're gonna do this. We're gonna cut your taxes. We're gonna get rid of regulations. We're gonna rebuild your military. We're gonna this and that and that and that."" And I did everything, and more than everything. We're gonna take care of our vets.",Donald Trump
"We just got a 91% approval rating on the vet, from the vets, on the V.A. Okay? No, but think of it. We did everything we said we were going to do. But there is much more -- And you know what? That was a record. There was never a campaign. Nobody's ever seen a campaign like that. That and Brexit. Look at him.",Donald Trump
"Look at him. We have Nigel. I spotted Nigel. Oh, Nigel. But I actually did see a list, Nigel. They said the victory of President Trump was number one. Brexit was number two, but it was a distant number two. And, and even Nigel agrees with that. No, Nigel's been fantastic. What a, what a voice. He's a great voice, a great guy.",Donald Trump
"Thank you. Thank you. It's an honor to have you. It's an honor. [Audience chants ""Nigel""] They know, Nigel. Brexit. Mr. Brexit. But, uh, the level of enthusiasm and I think you're gonna see a great red wave tomorrow. And I think it's gonna blow them away. And we get Florida and we get Pennsylvania and we're gonna get, we're gonna get New Hampshire.",Donald Trump
"We're gonna get New Hampshire. Yeah. It's a -- Get New York. Can you believe that? See, the a -- the disadvantage, the disadvantage we have, the disadvantage we have -- 'Cause I think in certain ways you campaign totally differently. The disadvantage we have with the Electoral College, you automatically lose, automatically.",Donald Trump
"I don't care if you bring back Abraham Lincoln and George Washington as his running mate. You lose New York, Illinois, and California, okay? So now you're, you got three of the biggest and the biggest, but you have three monster states, that's an automatic loss. So you're starting off, so then you have to run.",Donald Trump
"And so we ran Florida, and then we got Georgia. By the way, we're doing very well in Georgia. We got Georgia. We got North Carolina. We got Pennsylvania. That was a very important deal. We got Pennsylvania. We got everything. Then we got Wisconsin and Michigan. We said, ""Whoa."" Remember they wouldn't give you the credit?",Donald Trump
"We were two points short. We were at 98% of the vote tabulated, 98. And it stayed there for hours. And if I lost every single vote, right? Every -- And I still win. So I say, ""Why aren't they calling Pennsylvania?"" They wouldn't do you the honor. And then they called Wisconsin, great state. And they called Michigan, which hadn't been won in years and years.",Donald Trump
"And they took the glamor. So, will you please, uh, give yourself the glamor this time? Give yourself the glory, okay? And make sure your governor doesn't cheat, okay, if you could? Because they're known for very bad things, very, very bad things here. Can you imagine a pollster saying, ""You have to allow 5% in Pennsylvania for cheating""? That's a terrible thing to say.",Donald Trump
"Of course, everybody knows it's true, but. No, but we have a lot of eyes watching. They never had eyes watching. We've got a lot of very powerful eyes watching them. They don't want that to happen to themselves. Together, we will defeat the corrupt establishment and we'll dethrone the failed political class.",Donald Trump
"We will drain the Washington swamp and we will save the American dream. We're gonna save the American dream. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lock down or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic, and we build the greatest economic country that we've ever had. There'll be nothing like it.",Donald Trump
"We will mass distribute the vaccine. You know, we've done such a great job with this whole thing. You look at Europe. They're spiking. It's every, you know, they're saying, ""Look at the way Germany's doing. Look at the way France is doing. Look at Spain. Look at now Italy,"" right? You know, Italy had a really rough patch.",Donald Trump
"Well, they're all, they're all, uh, having a lot of problems, you know. I say, what -- They don't use those examples anymore. But we have better numbers than all of them. You look at our numbers, they're better, and it's bigger and it -- and you don't get, and you don't get a lot of, you know, a lot of the numbers, you don't get, because believe it or not, there is some countries that don't give you an honest kick, right.",Donald Trump
"You know that, right? It will quickly eradicate. The vaccine will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. And let me tell you, we're rounding the corner anyway, but we have the vaccines coming very shortly. They didn't want to give me the credit. They were saying, ""No, don't."" Oh, they fought me like crazy.",Donald Trump
"Did you see that? They didn't want it to happen before the election, but everybody knows. So we have the vaccine. It's gonna be very quickly delivered by our military. Our military is ready to go logistically. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state, locking you in your home, but you're already locked in your home, so.",Donald Trump
"I hope that doesn't take, uh, away any of your incentive. You're already locked in your home. While letting far left rioters roam free. Isn't that something, right? You can't go to church. You can't take your family to dinner. But you can let people riot down the middle of your beautiful shopping streets, knocking the hell out of people, burning down your stores, like in Minneapolis.",Donald Trump
"Burning the hell out of the place until we sent in the National Guard. That ended in 31 minutes. It was amazing when they started getting whacked with tear -- They were, I hope they weren't aiming. Did you see Ali Velshi, he went down. Ali, I don't even know who the hell his is. I just know he, he does a very nice job of shaving his head. ""This is Ali Velshi, and this is a friendly protest,"" and behind him, the entire city is burning.",Donald Trump
"It's like Berlin on its worst day, right? This is afraid -- You know, they don't report. You know if you have a bad, like in a Democrat-run city, they don't report it. Nobody even -- I don't watch, uh, CNN actually. So, I, I don't know about it. But I did see the clips. And didn't Ali Velshi then get hit on the knee with tear gas from our, from our great National Guard?",Donald Trump
"No, he got hit. He went down. ""I'm down. I'm down."" Uh, what a group of people. CNN, how dishonest is CNN? But you know what, I think NBC is more dishonest than CNN. I think NBC and ABC, I think ABC is terrible. I mean, ABC is absolutely -- How about, how about where they interview me and every question is a kill.",Donald Trump
"They're going for the kill. And then they interview sleepy Joe and it's like, oh, the most boring interviews. They don't ask him anything. They don't ask him whether or not he's corrupt. Are you corrupt. Hey, Sleepy Joe, are you corrupt? Remember, I asked him that question, and Chris Wallace of Fox wouldn't allow it.",Donald Trump
"I said, ""Why? Why? Why won't you?"" ""Well, I don't think it's appropriate to ask right now."" Chris Wallace. He is not Mike. He will never be Mike. He tries hard, but he will not be Mike. You know why? Doesn't have the talent. The Biden lock down will be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Easter, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no 4th of July, and basically no future for American youth.",Donald Trump
"Other than that, actually it's quite a wonderful thing. A vote for Biden is a vote for lock downs, lay-offs and misery. You're gonna have a miserable time. You know what the, the fake news doesn't know? They're getting the highest ratings in the history of television. When Trump is gone, they're all going bankrupt.",Donald Trump
"They will go down. They're gonna say, ""Oh, I wish he-"" They're gonna be calling, ""We want Trump to run again. We want him to run again."" The fake news. The New York Times, the failing New York Times, will be out of business. No, no, can you imagine, yeah, four more years. It's true though, right? Can you imagine, can you imagine these people, they're getting the highest ratings on television.",Donald Trump
"They've taken over for the NFL people don't like. How about basketball? How about Lebron? I felt badly for Lebron. I felt very badly. Down 71 percent. The cha -- and that's for the champion. I did watch one, I did watch one shot, I got bored, back forth, back forth. You know why? When they don't respect our country, when they don't respect our flag, nobody wants to watch.",Donald Trump
"Nobody. And the NFL is way down. The NFL is way down. You got to stand for our flag. You got to really be great to our flag and to our anthem, and if you don't do that we're not watching. [Audience chants ""Lebron James sucks""] What a crowd. What a crowd. Hey, I have three more of these to do. Do you, do you want me to stay with you all day?",Donald Trump
"Yes. So, yesterday, I did five. I actually did six, because I did one early for some people, but I actually did six, but I did five, I got home at two o'clock in the morning. In Miami, I got home two o'clock in the morning. And I said, ""Good, what time do we start tomorrow?"" ""Uh, eight o'clock, sir."" Oh, I said, ""Great, let's go."" But you know what it is?",Donald Trump
"I'm doing a run, a great, great marathon. Everyone, even the n -- One thing I'll say, they say, I can't believe, you know, cause sleepy Joe will go out and he'll talk for ten minutes. He's very agitated, you notice? He's so angry. He's got the, he's got the shades on now. They should be a little bit larger.",Donald Trump
"The aviators, right? Are they called aviators? He's got the aviators on and he's so angry. He's just r -- and he's reading every word. He never goes off teleprompter, because he gets lost if he, he can't go off teleprompter. He gets lost. No, but the anger. But it's not really anger. It's agitation. Do you know what that means?",Donald Trump
"Right? That's what happens, is when you lose it, you get very, he's, can happen to all of us someday. But it can't, you can't let it happen to your president, I'm sorry. But he was so angry, he was so agitated this morning, the glasses were pouring off, every, the mask, he kept, on, off, on. There's nobody around him.",Donald Trump
"The closest person's about 60 feet away. A reporter that can't believe he got this good location in a circle that's supposed to be for VIPs, right? Now, he's got Lady Gaga. Lady Gaga is not too good. I can tell you plenty of stories. I could tell you stories about Lady Gaga. I know a lot of stories about Lady Gaga.",Donald Trump
"And Jon Bon Jovi, every time I see him, he kisses my ass. ""Oh, oh, Mr. President."" But, he'll get, he'll get something out of it, just like everyone is, but you know what happens, you bring in some of these -- they don't draw -- by the way, we draw much bigger crowds than these people, but you know what happens?",Donald Trump
"He'll sing a song or two, and then he'll leave, and the crowd will leave, and sleepy Joe's up there talking. That happened to Hilary, too, right? They got Beyonce, and they got JayZ right? JayZ? And he started using the F word, do you remember? In front of this crowd, and it was unbel -- he was using the F word, F word, F word, and the crowd is going -- And then, they left, and the crowd left, and Hilary was standing on stage with an empty place, and she was talking.",Donald Trump
"And she lost, and people were surprised. Let me tell you something, when you look at these crowds that we're getting. There's never been anything like it. This is just not the crowds. This is your ultimate poll. This is not the crowds of a second place finisher. You know they said, yesterday, they said, ""Well, you know, some people are here since Nigel, they're here from 24 hours, 48. We have, guys, we have people in line for three, for days, and then the, the press says, ""But will they vote?"" Well, wait a minute, they're willing to go, they're willing to wait four days, three days, two days, one day, on line, will they vote?",Donald Trump
"Will they stand there for an hour and vote? I think they're gonna vote? [Inaudible] who is going to vote? Okay. It, and seriously, is there anybody here who's going to vote for sleepy Joe? Anybody? No? No. Is there, is there anybody that would have the courage to put up their hand? [Inaudible]. No. Oh, but he was born in Scranton.",Donald Trump
"What a phony he is. He was born in Scranton. ""I'm a Scranton boy."" Did you see? I'm tired of the smart people. Did you see where he said this? ""I'm tired of the smart people?"" But we want a smart person as president. You gotta have a smart -- No, he said -- Yeah, he made a lot of bad moves yesterday, didn't he?",Donald Trump
"He was having a bad day yesterday. He's tired of smart people. No, you can't get too tired of them. None of that -- To me, that's an amazing statement. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then go cast your ballot. You cast your ballot. We're changing, we're changing things to you could say what it used to be, but maybe it used to be a little bit like this, but it was never like this.",Donald Trump
"Things change, I think, with big tech. I think it really changed. Joe Biden personally ran the swine flu, right? He ran H1N1, remember? He can't remember that. He always goes, ""No, N1H1, isn't it?"" No, no. H comes before N, Joe. Just remember it that way. H1N1 swine flu. Remember he said, ""Uh, the, what was that called?",Donald Trump
"Who was that governor from, I think it was Utah. He's a Mormon. What was his name? His name was Romney."" Oh, great. He, he's another beauty. He failed horribly and he was the laughing stock of Washington, so he ran the swine flu operation. He was the laughing stock of Washington. Now on something much more lethal that we have done a great job on, except with public relations.",Donald Trump
"I would say if I had Nigel handling my public relations, I would have been much better. We have done a great job on this, and you compare us to other places, and you see in bringing back the economy, opening it up, except in public relations. But his own Chief of Staff said that he was absolutely terrible.",Donald Trump
"He didn't have a clue. He didn't know what he was doing. And he told us, right, that I was xenophobic because I closed it to China, which was highly and heavily infected. And then he runs and he says I should have closed it earlier. I said, ""How does he get out of that one?"" You know how he gets out of that one?",Donald Trump
"The press doesn't report it. They refuse to report it. The only way I can do that is, look, I got all live television, all the lights. And the only way, you know, they can't keep it off. Only for one reason. I get very big ratings. If I didn't get big ratings, there'd be no way of communicating. Oh, and they're gonna miss those ratings some day.",Donald Trump
"Some day they're gonna miss them. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that Biden has been wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four years. Now he worked with Biden. He worked with him, and he said he was wrong on like everything, and he is. And he, he is.",Donald Trump
"But you don't have to take my word for it. Because this happens to be a state that I love, I spent a fortune on building these screens. I, you got two of them. Wow. Usually I bring one. It's a lot cheaper. Roll the video please. Roll it. Play it. [Video Begins]",Donald Trump
"Where's Dan Meuser. Meuser! Thank you very much. Thanks Dan. Fred Keller. G.T. Thompson, that's good. With you, with the three of you -- what warriors you've been. What warriors you've been Thank you very much. They were there at the beginning and they have been with me all the way. And do you have a couple of former members that we love that we think are great?",Donald Trump
"Lou Barletta and Tom Marino. Thank you very much, Tom, Lou. Thank you. Thank you very much. How are your elections going? By the way, Dan, how are you guys going? You're doing good? We're going to win Pennsylvania, it's a guarantee? Good, that's good. So in -- you've got to vote for those guys. That's great --  that's a great group.",Donald Trump
"So you're really you districts are looking good. You need an extra tweet or anything? You don't need -- this group doesn't need anything. And also thank you, fellas for coming. What are you going to re-run for office, Tom and Lou? You gonna -- You have anything you're thinking about? Look at them. They look healthy as can be.",Donald Trump
"Congrashional -- congressional candidate, Jim Bognet. Thank you, Jim. Thank you -- and a woman who is doing an incredible job, campaign chair Bernie Comfort.",Donald Trump
"Bernie, thank you. How's it going, Bernie? We're gonna have a big victory tomorrow, I think, huh? We're gonna have a big, a big one. We better, Bernie, I'll fire you so fast. Another great friend of mine, a great guy, David Urban.",Donald Trump
"David. Thank you, David. And somebody that I know very well. He's a tall, young gentleman. His name is Eric Trump, and he's done great. He's done great. Oh, and I see Jared Kushner right over here. Middle East Peace. Middle East Peace. Jared usually likes to stay in the plane and work. He's working on Middle East Peace and doing a great job.",Donald Trump
"You see what we're doing. Thank you, Jared. Thank you, very much. For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders but not defending our border. But, now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are building our jobs, our factories and our troops, back home to the USA where they belong.",Donald Trump
"For 47 years Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young black men super predators all the time. To every black American, go tomorrow and vote for Trump. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, jail you, and betray you, which is what he did.",Donald Trump
"I'm fighting for you, and I got criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott. Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina, who's great. And funding for historically black colleges and universities. We got them the funding, long-term funding. And I say it all the time. I say it like this, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, a lot of people like me to see, leave the word possible out, there is no president that has done more for the black community than Donald Trump.",Donald Trump
"It's true. And you're seeing that, by the way, you see what's going on in Florida. The numbers are very high, like nobody's seen before, with the black community, and with the Hispanic American community. Oh, the Hispanic American c -- they're liking Trump. I've done a lot for them, and they like me, and I like them.",Donald Trump
"I always have actually. And they are voting for us, very big. They're coming out in Florida in numbers, and the democrats are very worried. They're saying, ""What's going on? What's going on?"" You know what's going on? I've done a good job, that's what's going on. So, I want to thank, we have to see what the final numbers are, but I think I can say in advance, African American community, Hispanic American community, uh, it's been incredible what's gone on in Florida, thank you very much.",Donald Trump
"Thank you very much. You notice, they're not talking about Florida too much, right? They're not talking. We get Florida, we get Pennsylvania, you watch. Under my leadership we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. You know, the wall, the wall is over 400 miles long. It'll be finished soon, and they don't talk about that one any more either, do they?",Donald Trump
"They don't talk about it. You know, when you have success they never talk about it. And ger -- you know what's happening? You know what's going on, right? I mean, other countries are coming in, they're studying what we're doing. All over the place, they're studying, because what we've done, nobody has been able to do.",Donald Trump
"Joe Biden has pledged open borders, free health care for illegal aliens. No, not for you. See, I delayed that a little bit. No, free health care for illegal aliens. They want to give them more than they give us. And deadly sanctuary cities. We believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.",Donald Trump
"The Biden/Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorist nations by a staggering 700 percent, flooding into your towns and cities. I am keeping, if it's okay with Pennsylvania, I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Is that okay? You know, I passed a ban, early on and it, uh, ultimately got approved by the United States Supreme Court.",Donald Trump
"But I passed the ban because we want people coming into our country that can love us, and come in through merit, and all sorts of things. We don't want people coming into our country that hate us, can't stand us, and want to do harm to our citizens, okay? So the ban was quite controversial, but it's had a big impact.",Donald Trump
"It's had a big impact. And you know, one of the reasons we're gonna win Minnesota? Ilhan Omar. Ilhan Omar. Although she loves our country very much, she loves our country very much, doesn't she? We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military. We have the finest military, the finest weaponry in the world.",Donald Trump
"All made in the USA. We're the envy of Russia and China and North Korea. We have the best equipment in the world. Rockets, and missiles, and submarines, and everything that we're building, nobody's ever seen anything like it. $2.5 trillion, made in the USA. We also passed veterans. We passed for our veterans.",Donald Trump
"VA Choice, after 44 years. And VA Accountability, okay? VA Account -- THat's where you say, ""You're fired, get the hell out of here. You're not treating our vets right."" We got -- I told you, we got the highest rating, the highest approval rating that, uh, has ever been given by our vets. 91% approval. Who are the 9%? Oh, they'll find somebody within the 9%, they'll be on television.",Donald Trump
"We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the world's top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years. They worked on it for 52 years, and instead of endless war we are forging peace in the Middle East.",Donald Trump
"Good job he's doing. Good job, my man. A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. And who was a very distinguished person within the Republican party? The late, great, Abraham Lincoln. Please remember that. He was very presidential. He's the only one I said, ""Maybe I can't be that presidential."" But -- He was very presidential when he wore the hat, especially, right?",Donald Trump
"Over the net four years we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That's already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. You've got them.",Donald Trump
"You've got them. With God's help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment -- your second amendment is gone if I don't get in. If I don't get in, your second amendment, wave goodbye. And I'll be sitting home and I'll be saying, ""I told the people of Pennsylvania, you better -- you better vote for Trump."" No, your second amendment is under siege. [Audience member calls out ""Amy Coney Barrett""] That's right, we put Amy on.",Donald Trump
"You happy with Amy? Everyone loves Amy. Thank you. You know we do. They don't talk about that enough. They say it's the most important thing a president can do. So at the end of my first term, I will have approximately 300 federal judges, which is a big percentage of the judiciary. And three great Supreme Court Justices.",Donald Trump
"That's a lot. Many presidents have gotten to choose none. Hey, whatever happened to packing the court, you know? This guy's running, he never gave an answer. Maybe he's smarter than we think. Whatever happened? He never gave the answer. He never said -- he said he was gonna tell us. He never -- We're running.",Donald Trump
"You know, people are casting votes. You cannot elect somebody that's going to pack the court, and he's gonna pack the court. And he didn't give us a list of the radical left judges he wants to put on, either. So he got away with it, so he got away with it. He just did, because the press never pressed him, right?",Donald Trump
"See, there's the case. If that were me, I could never, ever get away. He got away with it because the fake news wouldn't press it. He never talked about packing the court, and we're voting right now. He shouldn't get a vote unless he tells you, because you will destroy this country. That's a big thing, packing the court.",Donald Trump
"Can you imagine? But they never picked it up. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might. And we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices. You know, we're doing favored nations. We're going to have the lowest prices anywhere in the world.",Donald Trump
"The drug companies hate me so much. Aye aye aye. They are spending more money on ads than sleepy Joe Biden. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will have the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land and astronaut on Mars. NASA, NASA was like an abandoned place.",Donald Trump
"And now it's the hottest, it's the hottest place in the world for space. And that goes along with Space Force doesn't it? Huh, we did Space Force. We never even talked about Space Force in the campaign. But we needed it. When I saw Russia, when I saw China, we needed it. We got it approved. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students, and restore patriotic education to our schools.",Donald Trump
"We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American Flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump
"I know you well. I know you well. You're a rowdy bunch today, but that's okay. It's rowdy, but it's rowdy with love. It's rowdy with love. Still now. Tomorrow you have the power with your vote to save America. We will never be a socialist nation. That's what we're talking about. Oh, you're going to be a large scale version, very large scale of Venezuela.",Donald Trump
"That's what happens. It happens every single time. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get you co-workers. Even grab your boss by the tie, and say, come on boss. Let's go, we got to vote. We got to vote. For generations, Americas destiny was made forged in one in places like Bethlehem, and Bristol, eastern and Allentown, Pittsburgh, and Scranton.",Donald Trump
"Right here in Scranton. Our American ancestors gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country, and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world.",Donald Trump
"And the best is yet to come. [Audience chants ""USA""] Proud citizens like you help build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting.",Donald Trump
"And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, go out and vote tomorrow. We have made America powerful again. Our military has never been as, even close to what it is right now.",Donald Trump
We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Pennsylvania. Thank you Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump
Hello Pittsburgh,Joe Biden
 It’s good to be back,Joe Biden
 I’ll tell you what,Joe Biden
" First off, let’s honk for the outstanding band, The Funky Fly Project",Joe Biden
 Thank you,Joe Biden
 Thank you,Joe Biden
 Thank you,Joe Biden
 And special thanks to local and state elected officials who are here,Joe Biden
 I want to thank them a lot and I want to also thank your police department,Joe Biden
 I tell you what,Joe Biden
 They got a one heck of a motorcycle escort,Joe Biden
"You know, it was great seeing Franco again",Joe Biden
" I live in the other side of the state just below that town called Philadelphia, and I get in trouble because I talk about how much I like Pittsburgh and how much I like the Steelers",Joe Biden
" Now, let me tell you why",Joe Biden
" Franco and I were just in Latrobe together last month, and Franco and his teammate, a guy named Rocky Bleier, back in the day when the Rooney’s were really wonderful to me and my family",Joe Biden
" Because just a month after I was elected the United States Senate, I was 29 years old",Joe Biden
 It was December 18th,Joe Biden
 And it was a week before Christmas,Joe Biden
" I got a phone call, when I was hiring staff in Washington, saying a tractor trailer broadsided my wife and my three children Christmas shopping, and killed my wife and killed my wife and would kill my daughter",Joe Biden
 My two boys were very badly injured,Joe Biden
So I hustled home as quick as I could,Joe Biden
 And I stayed with them in that hospital room because they were really in tough shape,Joe Biden
" But on the 23rd, I believe it was, I decided that I was going to go out to Kmart and get a plastic Christmas tree",Joe Biden
" You know, those kinds they have on display, because you weren’t allowed to have any Christmas paraphernalia in the hospital that could catch fire, but I could get one of those",Joe Biden
" So I went out and I was only gone, it was the only time I was gone",Joe Biden
" I was gone for about, I guess, an hour, hour and a half",Joe Biden
"And I came back and both my boys for the first time, they were little guys, three and four years old, almost four and five",Joe Biden
" They had smiles on their face and each of them were holding a football signed by the entire steel curtain, the Pittsburgh team",Joe Biden
" And I said, “What happened, boys?” And they was the first time they smiled",Joe Biden
" And they said, “Rocky Bleier and Franco Harris came,” because guess what happened? The Rooneys, really fine, fine people, the Rooneys decided that they were going to send Rocky and Franco to see my boys",Joe Biden
 No publicity,Joe Biden
 They didn’t do any press,Joe Biden
 Didn’t let anybody know,Joe Biden
"… he, they didn’t do any press, didn’t let anybody know, they spent 45 minutes with my boys, they got in the plane and went home",Joe Biden
That’s who we are as a country,Joe Biden
" That’s something the President doesn’t understand, looking out for each other",Joe Biden
" The thousand acts of kindness, the decency that people used to show to one another, and still do, that he just doesn’t get",Joe Biden
"Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh there’s one more day, one more day to show who we are once again",Joe Biden
 Tomorrow we can end the presidency that has divided this nation,Joe Biden
" Folks in Homewood know, tomorrow we can put and end to a presidency that has failed to protect the nation",Joe Biden
" Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate across this nation, pouring gasoline on every racial incident in the country",Joe Biden
"Millions of Americans have already voted, over almost a hundred million now",Joe Biden
 Millions more will vote tomorrow,Joe Biden
" My message is simple, the power to change this country is in your hands",Joe Biden
" And I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting, no matter how he tries",Joe Biden
"There was a press article last week, and it read as follows, “Never before in modern presidential history has a candidate been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to repress the vote as Trump",Joe Biden
” Trump doesn’t want y’all voting,Joe Biden
 He don’t want Americans voting,Joe Biden
 He thinks only wealthy folks should vote,Joe Biden
" When America votes though, america will be heard",Joe Biden
" When America’s heard, the message is going to be out loud and clear: it’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home, go home",Joe Biden
"Look, we’re done with the chaos, we’re done with the racism, we’re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility, but we got a lot of work to do folks",Joe Biden
" If I’m elected president, we’re going to act, on day one we’re going to act to get COVID under control, on day one of my presidency I’ll put in action a plan that I’ve been talking about for months, masking, social distancing, testing, tracing, a plans for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics and vaccines when we get one",Joe Biden
"And most importantly, but he hasn’t done yet, a plan, a plan that addresses the fact that we can get everybody access to the vaccine when it comes",Joe Biden
" Folks there’s over 300 million people in America, everyone, everyone is going to get help",Joe Biden
 A plan to address the disproportionate way the virus is hitting the black community and minority communities,Joe Biden
" We’re seeing race-based disparities all across every aspect of this virus; higher infection rates, lower access to testing, a harder time, quarantine safely, lower access to quality treatment when you become infected, and tragically higher mortality rates, three times as high as the white population",Joe Biden
 One in 1000 black Americans have died from COVID so far,Joe Biden
" And by the end of this pandemic, if things continue as he’s allowing them to do until the next president takes office, there will be another 200,000 deaths projected",Joe Biden
 And that would mean one in 500 African-Americans will have died because of COVID,Joe Biden
That is absolutely outrageous,Joe Biden
" That is an attack, a mass casualty for black Americans",Joe Biden
" And this President, he knew in January how bad this virus was, in January he knew it",Joe Biden
" Some of you may remember vaguely if you turned on the television at the time, I wasn’t in office but I was talking about the fact that he got intelligence briefings laying out how dangerous it was coming from China, and where it was happening",Joe Biden
" And he said, no he didn’t read his intelligence briefing in the morning",Joe Biden
" Well, that didn’t surprise me, he doesn’t read",Joe Biden
But turns out he knew exactly how dangerous it was,Joe Biden
" Remember what he said to Bob Woodward, the famous journalist? He went on tape and he said to Woodward, he knew in January how dangerous it was and how many people could die, and he said nothing",Joe Biden
" He didn’t say a thing to you, me, or anybody else",Joe Biden
 He kept it secret,Joe Biden
 He hid it from the American people,Joe Biden
 He knew it was worse than the flu,Joe Biden
 He lied to the American people,Joe Biden
 He knew it wasn’t going to disappear,Joe Biden
" He kept telling us, America was coming, or maybe we should inject bleach into our veins",Joe Biden
" I mean, whatever, God, what a… anyway",Joe Biden
"And just Friday, this past Friday, had the gall to suggest that the American doctors and nurses, who are literally risking their lives to save lives on the front line of this crisis for nine months, that he suggested that these folks, know what he said they’re doing? He said, “Doctors are falsely inflating the deaths due to COVID because they want to make more money",Joe Biden
”,Joe Biden
"Now think about that, president of the United States of America",Joe Biden
" But then again, it doesn’t surprise me, he wouldn’t do anything unless he could make more money, not a joke",Joe Biden
 Everything to him is about how do you help yourself?,Joe Biden
"Folks, look the people of this nation have suffered and sacrificed for nine months, none more so than our doctors and our frontline healthcare workers",Joe Biden
" And it’s the President questioning their character, and their integrity, their commitment to his fellow Americans, the President questioning that? It’s a flat disgrace",Joe Biden
" And then last night Trump said, he’s going to fire Dr",Joe Biden
 Fauci,Joe Biden
" I got a better idea, let’s fire Trump, and I’ll hire Dr",Joe Biden
 Fauci,Joe Biden
"Look, the President has waved the white flag of surrender in this virus",Joe Biden
 I’ll never do that,Joe Biden
" He’s chief of staff said last week, “We’re not going to control this virus",Joe Biden
"” We’re not going to control the virus, the first step to beating the virus is defeating Donald Trump",Joe Biden
"Look folks, if we didn’t know this was happening, and somebody made a movie about this five years ago you’d think it was all crazy, but it’s real",Joe Biden
 It’s real what’s happening,Joe Biden
" Donald Trump, by the way, he keeps telling us what a great jobs president he has been, how many jobs he’s created",Joe Biden
" Well, I was just with President Obama in Detroit, in Flint, Michigan, my buddy",Joe Biden
 It was great to be with a president with real character,Joe Biden
" A President respected around the world, a President our kids could look up to",Joe Biden
" But did you know President Obama and I helped create more jobs in the last three years of our administration than Trump did the first three years of his, even before the pandemic hit? Did you know Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years who’s going to finish with his four years in office with fewer jobs under his leadership than when he started as president?",Joe Biden
"And black unemployment remains too high, too many black businesses are shuttered for good",Joe Biden
" Black-owned businesses are shutting down twice as fast as other businesses, and business communities of color have shuttered because they didn’t get the help, the money that Congress has passed",Joe Biden
 Congress passed over $2 trillion,Joe Biden
" You know the first thing what the President did? He fired the Inspector General, who’s supposed to follow where the money went",Joe Biden
" And guess what? Minority businesses, small businesses, they didn’t get the help",Joe Biden
 It went to the Mar-a-Lago crowd,Joe Biden
" Not a joke, his wealthy friends",Joe Biden
 He fired the Inspector General,Joe Biden
"You know, he sees the world from Park Avenue-",Joe Biden
He sees the world from Park Avenue,Joe Biden
 I have seen it from Scranton,Joe Biden
 I see it from where I grew up,Joe Biden
 I see it from here in Pittsburgh,Joe Biden
" Wall Street didn’t build this country, working people built this country",Joe Biden
" That’s always whose built the country, the middle class, and unions built the middle class",Joe Biden
"Folks, I believe we should be rewarding work not wealth in this country",Joe Biden
" Do you all realize that just as the pandemic started, the listed billionaires in America made another $300 billion? Not a joke, $300 billion they made in the middle of the pandemic",Joe Biden
" What’s going on here, folks?",Joe Biden
"Well, I’ve got a plan, and under my plan I commit to you no one making less than $400 grand is going to see a penny in taxes raised",Joe Biden
" But for a change, the wealthiest and the biggest corporations, 91 of the Fortune 500 companies pay zero in taxes after making billions of dollars",Joe Biden
" Well, guess what? Under a Biden administration, they’re going to start paying their fair share",Joe Biden
" Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse, a steelworker pay a higher tax rate, and this is the God’s truth, a higher tax rate than the super wealthy? And by the way, why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump?",Joe Biden
I’ve released 23 years of my tax returns,Joe Biden
 I had the dubious distinction of being listed as “the poorest man in Congress” for 36 years,Joe Biden
" And then when I got elected vice president it says, “It’s probable no man has ever assumed the office vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden",Joe Biden
” I assumed they weren’t speaking about intellectual assets,Joe Biden
" It could have been, but who knows?",Joe Biden
"Well, look, here’s my point, Trump and the only taxes that we’ve been able to find out through the New York Times in the one year he has, he paid $750 in taxes",Joe Biden
 Trump keeps talking about corruption,Joe Biden
" When’s the last time he heard of a president having a secret bank account in China? Which he did, we just found out, where he payed 50 times more tax in China than he did in the United States",Joe Biden
" Every time he starts talking about corruption, I say, “Release your tax return",Joe Biden
 What in the hell are you hiding? What are you hiding?” Not one…,Joe Biden
" Anyway, I won’t get into it",Joe Biden
"Look, we’re going to act to protect healthcare",Joe Biden
" Trump is going to Trump, like he just jammed through a Supreme Court nomination",Joe Biden
 You know why they did? To try to destroy the Affordable Care Act,Joe Biden
" Well, if they get their way, a hundred million Americans will lose the protections for preexisting conditions, including more than 5 million people here in the United States… I mean, excuse me, here in the state of Pennsylvania, over a hundred million in the United States",Joe Biden
 Millions of black Americans will be left uninsured and denied health coverage because of pre-existing conditions,Joe Biden
 And there are more preexisting conditions in poor communities than there are in others,Joe Biden
Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege,Joe Biden
 I think it’s a right,Joe Biden
" Look, I’ll not only restore Obamacare, I’ll build on it",Joe Biden
 You can keep your private insurance,Joe Biden
" If you like it, you can choose Medicare like public option",Joe Biden
" I’m going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, out-of-pocket spending, surprise billing",Joe Biden
" I’m going to lower prescription drugs by 60%, and that’s the truth",Joe Biden
" But by the way, how are you going to do it, Joe? Because those wealthy people are going to start paying their fair share",Joe Biden
"It’s not about punishing everyone, it’s about being fair",Joe Biden
 We’ll make sure that protections for people with pre-existing conditions remain,Joe Biden
" And meanwhile, Trump said, he’s publicly said if he’s reelected, he’s going to defund Social Security payments",Joe Biden
" The actuary in social security department said if he does that, that will eliminate, eliminate Medicare by 2023, after all the who people rely on Medicare",Joe Biden
" It’s not going to happen, by the way",Joe Biden
" We’re not going to let it happen, but that’s his plan",Joe Biden
" Go home and tell your grandparents and parents, we’ll protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which he won’t do",Joe Biden
" And finally, we need a vote now to deliver some racial justice in America",Joe Biden
" Look, a season of protest has broken out all across this nation",Joe Biden
" Protesting is not burning and looting and violence, that can’t be tolerated, it won’t",Joe Biden
 But those protests are a cry for justice,Joe Biden
" In the name of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, Walter Wallace, Jr",Joe Biden
", they’re not going to soon be forgotten",Joe Biden
" They’re not going to be forgotten by me, not by us, not by this country",Joe Biden
 They’ll inspire a whole new wave of justice in America,Joe Biden
"When I met with Floyd’s family, he has a little daughter who survived him, she’s six years old, and I knelt down and I talked to her",Joe Biden
 I started talking to her,Joe Biden
" You know what she said? She looked at me, she said, “Mr",Joe Biden
" Vice President, Daddy is going to change the world",Joe Biden
 Daddy’s going to change the world,Joe Biden
”,Joe Biden
"Folks, the country is ready",Joe Biden
" The country is ready, but not with Donald Trump as president",Joe Biden
 Now he wants us to believe so much he’s done for black Americans,Joe Biden
 You might have seen the debate I had with him,Joe Biden
 I was standing next to “Abraham Lincoln”,Joe Biden
" He said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anyone done as much for the African American community as I have",Joe Biden
"” I turned to him and asked him, “Abe,” he got offended",Joe Biden
 He got offended,Joe Biden
" Look, Pittsburgh, honk if you think his commitment of having done more for the African-American community than Abraham Lincoln is true",Joe Biden
 Honk your horn,Joe Biden
 Silence,Joe Biden
" You got it, man",Joe Biden
" Pittsburgh, honk if you think it’s a bunch of malarkey, his lying",Joe Biden
 You got it,Joe Biden
"Look, the truth is, Donald Trump has done more harm black America than any president in modern history",Joe Biden
" This is the same man who started the Birther Movement against my buddy, Barack Obama",Joe Biden
" This is the first man, this is the man who when the first black woman running for vice president, he looks at her and he calls her a monster",Joe Biden
" Oh yeah, man",Joe Biden
"And remember on stage with him When I asked about the Proud Boys, that racist group of white supremacists",Joe Biden
" I said, “Would you deny them?” He turned and he said, “I’m going to tell them to stand down and stand by",Joe Biden
"” When in God’s name did you ever expect an American president to say, who refused to denounce white supremacy, doesn’t believe systemic racism is a problem and won’t even say black lives matter",Joe Biden
 Black lives matter,Joe Biden
" And we’re going to work to deliver real police and criminal reform, justice reform",Joe Biden
" We know, we know what true justice is all about",Joe Biden
" It’s not only about a criminal justice system that’s fair, but it’s about being able to build wealth, jobs, homes, families",Joe Biden
" Folks, we’re in a situation where, think about it, how many people you know are working two jobs and still being in poverty? We need a national minimum wage of $15 an hour for everybody, period",Joe Biden
 Honk if you agree with me,Joe Biden
 Honk if you agree with me and my proposal,Joe Biden
"For first-term homebuyers, first-time home buyers, I promise you are going to get a $15,000 down payment for the first home",Joe Biden
 Honk,Joe Biden
"Honk for new capital to start businesses, because black entrepreneurs are equally successful as any other entrepreneurs, but they can’t get access",Joe Biden
 That’s why Barack and I started a program to give $1,Joe Biden
5 billion to local small business associations to lend money,Joe Biden
 That brought 30 billion off the sideline,Joe Biden
" Well, I’ve changed that to $15 billion, and we’re going to bring 150 off the sideline",Joe Biden
"Look, in addition to that, think about this",Joe Biden
 Education,Joe Biden
 Education is the key to movement,Joe Biden
" Well, guess what? There’s going to be free college education for state universities when I’m your president",Joe Biden
 I’m going to triple funding,Joe Biden
" And by the way, we can afford this, I promise you",Joe Biden
" I’m going to triple funding for Title I schools so a child can get a good public education, no matter what their zip code is",Joe Biden
" Allowing every three and four and five year olds to go to school, not daycare",Joe Biden
 That increases by 58% the prospects that child will go all the way through 12 years,Joe Biden
 And honk if you agree with me,Joe Biden
 I’m going to invest $70 billion in HBCUs at minority serving institutions,Joe Biden
 For real,Joe Biden
 [inaudible 00:28:35] institutions so future generations of black students can continue to get the very best education,Joe Biden
"Folks, Pennsylvania, 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in Barack and me",Joe Biden
" Now in 2020, I’m asking for your trust again in me and Kamala",Joe Biden
" By the way, she is one smart, bright, tough woman, man",Joe Biden
 I’m so proud,Joe Biden
 She said yes,Joe Biden
" Look, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president",Joe Biden
" That’s the job of a president, the duty to represent everyone, everyone",Joe Biden
 And you too have a duty,Joe Biden
" If you haven’t already voted, to vote tomorrow",Joe Biden
" Make a plan, get out to vote",Joe Biden
 Go to iowavote,Joe Biden
"com/pa and ask yourself if Donald Trump is so proud of his record, especially for African Americans, why does he make it so hard for us to vote?",Joe Biden
"And then remember the final words of my good friend and American hero, John Lewis, who recently died",Joe Biden
 He said “The vote is the most powerful non-violent change agent you have in a democratic society,Joe Biden
" You must use it, because if not, it’s guaranteed you’ll lose it",Joe Biden
”,Joe Biden
"Folks, please, please",Joe Biden
 Here’s the amazing thing,Joe Biden
" Here’s the amazing thing, folks",Joe Biden
 It’s about this moment in history,Joe Biden
" On the one hand, we’re facing the biggest threats about who we are and what we believe that we’ve seen in our lifetimes",Joe Biden
" But on the other hand, our future has never been more promising",Joe Biden
 I said it many times,Joe Biden
 I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I got elected as a 29 year old kid,Joe Biden
 And I mean it,Joe Biden
 Here’s why,Joe Biden
 We’re better positioned than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century,Joe Biden
 Our workers are three times as productive as workers in the biggest economies in the world,Joe Biden
 We have the strongest military in the history of the world,Joe Biden
 We have the most innovative entrepreneurs,Joe Biden
 We’re virtually energy independent,Joe Biden
(silence) We can do this,Joe Biden
 We’re better than we’ve been,Joe Biden
 We can be our best when we’re the United States of America,Joe Biden
 God bless you all and may God protect our troops,Joe Biden
 Go vote,Joe Biden
" We can get this done, I promise you",Joe Biden
You all must be crazy,Joe Biden
" As my mother from Scranton said, God love you",Joe Biden
 Thanks for being here,Joe Biden
" The one thing I’ve always been able to count on my whole career, unions",Joe Biden
 I know how to say union,Joe Biden
 I’m working for those unions,Joe Biden
" Hey folks, it’s good to be back in Beaver County",Joe Biden
" The fact is that we’ve been in a situation for a while here that… and Greg, thanks for the introduction, I do appreciate it",Joe Biden
One of the things about the iron workers is that I think you’re all crazy,Joe Biden
 You know what I mean? I remember iron workers endorsed me early on when I first ran for the Senate as a kid,Joe Biden
" A guy name Tommy [Shrank 00:00:47], and I used to walk in the union all the time and say anybody who’s crazy enough to walk up 16 stories on beam and shoot a rivet has to be nuts",Joe Biden
 But thank God you are,Joe Biden
" Where I grew up, you either joined a trade, you became a cop, you became a firefighter or a priest",Joe Biden
" I wasn’t competent at being any one of them, so look what happened to me",Joe Biden
"Folks look, Conner thank you for being here and thank you for all you’ve done",Joe Biden
" Ladies and gentlemen, this is about more than just an election this time out",Joe Biden
" There’s an awful lot at stake, and of course you’re going to send Conner back",Joe Biden
" That’s all right, I’m used to babies",Joe Biden
" Babies are allowed to cry, and anybody’s allowed to cry if they want",Joe Biden
 Anybody’s allowed to make noise too,Joe Biden
" Oh, well, look, I wanted to come by to say thank you personally",Joe Biden
" Thank you very, very much for what you’ve done",Joe Biden
" As the Mayor’s here, they tell me… I don’t know where the Mayor is",Joe Biden
" Where’s the Mayor? There you are, hey Mr",Joe Biden
" Mayor, thank you pal",Joe Biden
 Being Mayor’s a real job,Joe Biden
 They know where you live and Terry and Rob I want to thank you and everybody all over Beaver County,Joe Biden
"Folks, look, the fact is that from the very beginning of my career, I found myself in a situation where I’ve relied on labor",Joe Biden
 And I hope I’m demonstrated that labor can rely on me,Joe Biden
 We’re in a home stretch now,Joe Biden
" We’re in a home stretch and as my coach used to say in high and college, “It’s go time",Joe Biden
 It’s go time,Joe Biden
” Tomorrow’s the day,Joe Biden
 Tomorrow we’re going to send Conner back to Congress,Joe Biden
 We’re going to hear what labor has to say,Joe Biden
 We’re going to win Pennsylvania and we’re going to show the world what America stands for,Joe Biden
"Folks, as I said, I wanted to come by and thank you personally for canvassing",Joe Biden
 And thank the Mayor and everyone else that I just mentioned to you,Joe Biden
 The fact is that there’s a lot at stake in this election,Joe Biden
 We are really at one of those inflection points,Joe Biden
 This is going to be more than just who governs the next four years,Joe Biden
" What happens now, what happens tomorrow is going to determine what this country looks like for a couple generations",Joe Biden
 And that’s not a joke,Joe Biden
 I really generally believe that,Joe Biden
There’s so damn much at stake,Joe Biden
" And as we get this home stretch, you find yourself going home",Joe Biden
 At least I found myself going home,Joe Biden
 This is like home,Joe Biden
" I’m from Scranton, Pennsylvania",Joe Biden
" I grew up in Claymont, Delaware",Joe Biden
" And it used to be a steel town that had steel workers, used to have 5,800 steel workers in the town",Joe Biden
" All gone, all gone now",Joe Biden
 We got to get it back,Joe Biden
" We’re not going to get it back in Claymont, but we can get it back here in the United States",Joe Biden
"And folks, the fact is that as I said we’re heading to a home stretch",Joe Biden
 We know the stakes have never been higher,Joe Biden
 We know they’ve never been higher,Joe Biden
 My dad used to have an expression,Joe Biden
" He’d say, “Joey,” he lost a job in Scranton when coal died when I was a kid",Joe Biden
" And we moved on to Claymont, Delaware",Joe Biden
 He took us home to my grand pops house,Joe Biden
 And he made what I call the longest walk a mom or dad has to make,Joe Biden
" Up a short flight of stairs to the kids bedrooms to say, “Honey, I’m sorry",Joe Biden
 You can’t go back to that school,Joe Biden
 You can’t play in that Little League club anymore,Joe Biden
 Dad lost his job,Joe Biden
 We’re going to have to move,Joe Biden
 We can’t stay where we are,Joe Biden
"” And he made that walk, took us over to my grand pop’s house in Scranton and what happened was he said, “I’m going down to Delaware",Joe Biden
 There’s jobs down there,Joe Biden
 I’ll come home every weekend,Joe Biden
 It’ll probably take me a year to get one,Joe Biden
 I can bring everybody down,Joe Biden
” And so that’s exactly what happened,Joe Biden
"From that point on, when my dad would talk about a job, he’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck",Joe Biden
 It’s about your dignity,Joe Biden
 It’s about respect,Joe Biden
 It’s about your place in the community,Joe Biden
" It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be okay",Joe Biden
” Not many people are saying that these days,Joe Biden
 Too many people are worried,Joe Biden
I’ve never forgotten growing up in a hard working family in Scranton,Joe Biden
" The lesson that Donald Trump has never learned, because he can only see the world from Park Avenue",Joe Biden
 He can’t see what families like yours and mine have gone through,Joe Biden
 So he refuses to do the work to get this virus under control,Joe Biden
 He refuses to do the work to get our schools and our small businesses the resources they needed to stay open,Joe Biden
" Firefighters, teachers, cops, a whole lot of hard working folks",Joe Biden
 Refused to bring Congress together,Joe Biden
" They passed the money, but he refused to bring them together to provide for their families, the working families",Joe Biden
 Because he thinks Wall Street built this country,Joe Biden
" Well I got news for him, you already know it, Wall Street didn’t build America, middle class did and unions built the middle class",Joe Biden
 Unions built the middle class,Joe Biden
 That’s a fact,Joe Biden
 That is a natural fact,Joe Biden
"Look, I see the world from Scranton",Joe Biden
 I see this world from working class towns all around this state,Joe Biden
" And that’s why I build back better plan that I’m going to do is for the first time in a long time, we’re going to start rewarding work, not wealth",Joe Biden
" We’re not going to raise taxes for anybody making less than $400,000 bucks a year",Joe Biden
" If you make more than that, guess what? You’re going to start paying your fair share",Joe Biden
 You’re going to start stepping up,Joe Biden
"I’m going to ask the big corporations, the wealthy, to step up",Joe Biden
" 90 of the Fortune 500 companies, trying to railroad you guys, 90 of them, didn’t pay a penny in taxes",Joe Biden
" We’re going to invest the money that we collect of working people, creating millions of good paying union jobs",Joe Biden
" Two trillion dollars to build a more resilient infrastructure, roads, bridges, water systems",Joe Biden
 A whole lot more,Joe Biden
 Done by certified labor,Joe Biden
" And by the way, no matter how many times Trump tries to lie about it, I will not ban fracking",Joe Biden
 I never said I would,Joe Biden
"But I’m going to end Trumps incentives, to send jobs overseas",Joe Biden
 We have a trade strategy right now where you get 10% cut in your tax if you send a job overseas,Joe Biden
 We’re going to reverse it,Joe Biden
" You bring a job home, you get 10% and I want to promise you one thing, the president has control of $600 billion, handing out contracts for construction",Joe Biden
" For everything from building aircraft carriers, to public housing",Joe Biden
" Well here’s the promise I’m making to you, not one single contract will be let to a contractor who doesn’t have products that are all made in America",Joe Biden
 That’s a guarantee,Joe Biden
 Every one,Joe Biden
"We’re allowed to do that now, but we’ve never done it",Joe Biden
" It’s about time we stepped up and made sure people… by the way, one other thing I want to mention here",Joe Biden
 Donald Trump talks about himself as a tough guy,Joe Biden
 I grew up with guys like him around in Scranton,Joe Biden
 They thought because they had more money than us they could look down their nose at us,Joe Biden
" They thought that because they came from well known families, they somehow were better",Joe Biden
" Well let me tell you something, he talks about how tough he is, how hard working he is, how he’s done so much",Joe Biden
" Let me tell the things that bothered me most in this campaign and I have to tell you, the way he talked about our veterans as being losers, losers? What’s this guy all about? Who is he? He doesn’t understand what’s going on",Joe Biden
"Folks, my son was the Attorney General of Delaware",Joe Biden
 He gave up his seat to go fight in Iraq for a year,Joe Biden
" He won the Bronze Star, [inaudible 00:09:02] service medal",Joe Biden
" And he came home and he died of cancer, but he came home and guess what? He was no loser",Joe Biden
 Trump’s a loser,Joe Biden
 And all of you who served,Joe Biden
 All of you who have served,Joe Biden
 I really mean it,Joe Biden
" Think about it, think about it",Joe Biden
 Is there any wonder why… this is the first president that I’m aware of,Joe Biden
" The six top Generals to work for him, six, four star Admirals and Generals, they all left to say he wasn’t worthy of being Commander in Chief",Joe Biden
 They quit,Joe Biden
"McRaven, [inaudible 00:09:44] Special Forces",Joe Biden
 There are the guys who did a lot commanding,Joe Biden
" They both endorsed me and they came along, 22 Four Stars stepped up and endorsed me because they knew I’d have their back as Commander in Chief",Joe Biden
 This guy doesn’t get it,Joe Biden
"I really mean it, many of you served",Joe Biden
 Took physical courage to do it,Joe Biden
 He doesn’t get it,Joe Biden
" Folks, we owe the military",Joe Biden
" One percent of the Americans, are protecting the other 99% of us",Joe Biden
 We owe them big,Joe Biden
"Look, we can only get this done though, we can only get this done in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvanians vote",Joe Biden
 We got to make sure everybody returns their ballot or votes tomorrow,Joe Biden
" Make sure everyone, everyone you know does the same",Joe Biden
 It’s time to rebuild the backbone of this country,Joe Biden
" The middle class, and this time bring everybody along",Joe Biden
 Everybody,Joe Biden
 It’s time to unite this country,Joe Biden
" There’s an amazing thing about this moment on history; on the one hand we’re facing the biggest threat to who we are, what we believe in our lifetimes, but on the other hand our future has never been more promising",Joe Biden
"I’ve said it many times, I’m more optimistic about America’s future today, than when I got elected as a 29 year old kid to the Senate",Joe Biden
 Here’s why: we’re in a better position than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century,Joe Biden
 Our workers are three times productive as workers around the world,Joe Biden
 We have the biggest economy in the world,Joe Biden
 The strongest military in the history of the world,Joe Biden
 We have the most innovative entrepreneurs,Joe Biden
 We’re virtually energy independent and we have more great research universities than the rest of the world combined,Joe Biden
No other nation can touch us,Joe Biden
 No other nation can lead us,Joe Biden
" We can lead by the power of our example, not just the example of our power",Joe Biden
" The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself, and that’s exactly what Donald Trump’s been trying to do from the very beginning",Joe Biden
 Divide America,Joe Biden
 Pitting American’s against one another,Joe Biden
 Rural versus urban,Joe Biden
" Based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, our religion",Joe Biden
 That’s wrong,Joe Biden
 That’s not who we are,Joe Biden
 Everybody knows who Donald Trump is,Joe Biden
" But we’re about honor, integrity, dignity",Joe Biden
 This is the United States of America,Joe Biden
 We’ve got to let them show who we are,Joe Biden
" We choose, we choose hope over fear",Joe Biden
 We choose unity over division,Joe Biden
" We choose science over fiction, and yeah we choose truth over lies, constant lies",Joe Biden
[inaudible 00:13:03],Joe Biden
" It’s time to stand up, take back this democracy",Joe Biden
 We can do this,Joe Biden
 We’re so much better than we’ve been,Joe Biden
" We can be [inaudible 00:13:23]… you have ever seen, I guarantee you a seat at the table",Joe Biden
" God love you all, and thank you, thank you, thank you",Joe Biden
 Let’s get this vote out,Joe Biden
 May God protect our troops,Joe Biden
 Thank you,Joe Biden
I want to do something that I feel very proud about,Joe Biden
" The son I told you about who I lost, I want his two children to come up here with me",Joe Biden
 Come here,Joe Biden
" This is Natalie, don’t be silly",Joe Biden
"Well, this young woman is the co-founder of Phoenix, of Sherman Phoenix, in Milwaukee, taking a neighborhood that was beginning to be a part of the ash then, and has brought it back to life miraculously",Joe Biden
 I am so proud to introduce Joanne Sabir,Joe Biden
" Come on, girl",Joe Biden
I hope you got masks on everyone,Joe Biden
 It’s cold,Joe Biden
" Hello Milwaukee, it’s good to be back",Joe Biden
" I’ll tell you what, they told me it’s going to be indoors",Joe Biden
 You’re a hardy bunch in Milwaukee,Joe Biden
" Sheriff, how are you doing? Look, Terrence, thank you",Joe Biden
 Thank you for sharing your story,Joe Biden
 Thank you for your exercising your power as a young voter first time,Joe Biden
" You’re an inspiration man, and I want you to know that a lot of us in here growing up as kids understood what is like to know bullies",Joe Biden
"I had planned on saying this in light of your introduction, Sheriff and Tom’s heard me say this before, and the mayor",Joe Biden
" When I was a kid, I used to stutter",Joe Biden
" You want to learn what bullies are like, be a stuttering kid, talk like that everybody thinks they can make fun of you",Joe Biden
 So I’m used to bullies,Joe Biden
" Matter of fact, they used to have a nickname in school, Tom",Joe Biden
 They used to call me Shoe Leather,Joe Biden
" The reason they call me Shoe Leather, I was a little [inaudible 00:03:32], but you could beat me, but I’d hurt you",Joe Biden
 It’s like [inaudible 00:15:36] a shoe leather,Joe Biden
"But I’ll tell you what, I think you made a great metaphor about what’s going on here",Joe Biden
 You’re making your family really proud,Joe Biden
" And Joanne, I want to thank you for all you do to lift up this community, bringing pride and dignity and jobs in Milwaukee",Joe Biden
" My dad used to have an expression, he lost his job in Scranton, Pennsylvania when I was a kid and he took us to my grand pops, my mom’s dad, my grand mom was passed",Joe Biden
 And so he said you’re going to live here for about a year,Joe Biden
" I’m going to commute every day from Scranton, Pennsylvania, down to Wilmington, Delaware, where there’s jobs, Joey and when I get one, I’ll be back for you, and your mom, and your brother and your sister",Joe Biden
"My sister is with me today too, where’s my sister, Valerie? She’s my best friend in the world",Joe Biden
" Anyway, Val",Joe Biden
" And he said, it’s only 157 miles away",Joe Biden
" Wilmington, Delaware",Joe Biden
 He’d come home every weekend,Joe Biden
" And when we got down to Wilmington and he finally got a job, that we could bring us down and be able to rent an apartment, he used to always have an expression Sheriff, he’d say, “You know Joey, a job’s a lot more than a paycheck",Joe Biden
 It’s about your dignity,Joe Biden
 It’s about respect,Joe Biden
 It’s about your place in the community,Joe Biden
" It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay",Joe Biden
 It’s going to be okay,Joe Biden
””,Joe Biden
"As Gwen knows, not an awful lot of people out there right now",Joe Biden
" A lot of hard working people who can’t say it’s going to be okay, they’re in trouble",Joe Biden
" Statistics show, for example that over 50% of the American people think actually it’s 49% to be precise, got a bill for 400 bucks in one month they didn’t anticipate, they’d have to borrow the money or sell something",Joe Biden
 So a lot of people were still hurting,Joe Biden
" And Gwen, let’s send her back because I tell you what, she is a voice from Milwaukee, a voice from the country, and I’m sure glad you’re on my side, kid",Joe Biden
 Sure glad you’re on my side because I’m on yours,Joe Biden
"I want to thank you all for welcoming me today and Tom, you’ve been a good friend and for a long time, thank you pal",Joe Biden
" Tom endorsed me when they said Joe Who’s running for what? Anyway, but thank you, Tom",Joe Biden
" And Sheriff Lucas and Sheriff Mahoney, and Ambassador John [Frenz 00:06:06], I want to thank you all for being here, there you are",Joe Biden
 Okay,Joe Biden
"Look, it’s great to be back with you",Joe Biden
" Folks, there was only four days left",Joe Biden
 Millions of Americans have already voted,Joe Biden
 They’re telling me now it’s up to about 85 million Americans have already voted and millions more are going to vote before this election is over,Joe Biden
"And I believe when you use your power, the power to vote, you can change the course of the country and quite frankly, right now the course of the world, because it’s leaderless now",Joe Biden
 We’re going to start right here in Wisconsin,Joe Biden
" If Tom remembers, I came up here to campaign for Hillary and for a whole lot of reasons, not all which were her fault ended up not taking it as seriously",Joe Biden
 We thought it was different,Joe Biden
 I’ve been here a lot,Joe Biden
" And by the way, when I got elected, if I get elected, I’m coming back, Tom",Joe Biden
"Look at these final days, we got to keep our sense of empowerment here",Joe Biden
 A sense of optimism,Joe Biden
 What we can do together,Joe Biden
 But I know it’s hard,Joe Biden
" More than 225,000 people, I think it’s 229 as I speak, have already lost their lives to COVID-19",Joe Biden
" 2,000 here in Wisconsin, 600 here in Milwaukee County, each one immortalized by an empty chair this morning at breakfast or tonight at dinner",Joe Biden
 An empty chair at MacArthur Square,Joe Biden
 And now folks are getting hit by a new big wave of infections across the country,Joe Biden
"This week, Wisconsin, like other states set a new record for daily cases",Joe Biden
" Hospitals are running short on beds, just had to open a field hospital",Joe Biden
 That’s what we’re facing,Joe Biden
 We’ve now had nine million cases in the United States of America,Joe Biden
" We make up 4% of the world’s population,, we have 20% of the world’s deaths, nine million new cases nationwide, another tragic milestone, millions of people out of work, on the edge, and they can’t see the light, they’re not sure how dark it’s going to remain",Joe Biden
"Wisconsin is down 20,000 manufacturing jobs since this pandemic began",Joe Biden
 And the thing that bothers me the most was a president who gave up,Joe Biden
" Over the weekend, his chief of staff said what we knew",Joe Biden
 “We’re not going to control the pandemic,Joe Biden
” We’re not going to control the pandemic,Joe Biden
"Yet last week when I debated the president, he said, quote, “We’re rounding the corner",Joe Biden
 It’s going away,Joe Biden
 We’re learning to live with it,Joe Biden
” You may remember what I said it may have been viewed as harsh by some,Joe Biden
" Told him, we’re not learning to live with it, you’re asking us to learning to die with it, because people continue to die",Joe Biden
" It’s estimated that over 200,000 more people will die between now and the end of the year by the leading experts who haven’t been wrong yet",Joe Biden
"Did you hear what he said today? He said today at a rally that our doctors are the problem because they’re putting their lives on the line, busting their necks, he said, they’re making up deaths from COVID-19 because they get more money",Joe Biden
 They’re making up deaths,Joe Biden
" People aren’t really dying from COVID, they’re dying from other things, but they’re saying it’s COVID to make the numbers go up",Joe Biden
 My Lord,Joe Biden
"By the way, is Monica [Wadry 00:21:53] here? Monica is an ICU nurse",Joe Biden
 I spent some time with Monica on the phone and her two kids and Monica told me what my son-in-law who’s a doc in Philly told me when this all began,Joe Biden
" While we’re waiting for PPP, the mask, and the gowns, and all the gear, so many docs, so many nurses, so many first responders after they did their job were afraid to go home because they’d take it home, the virus home to their children",Joe Biden
Monica told me how her husband would wait in the garage so she could change and put on a [inaudible 00:22:32] before she went in the house and shower,Joe Biden
" So many people, over a thousand Monicas have given their lives trying to save other lives",Joe Biden
 And this guy says that they’re raking it up because they want to make more money,Joe Biden
"Doctors and nurses go to work every single day, Donald Trump should stop attacking them and start doing his job",Joe Biden
" This is the same man who told us, when he was told about four weeks ago, three or four weeks ago that we’re losing a thousand lives a day, remember what he said? He said it is what it is",Joe Biden
 Ain’t that useful? It is what it is,Joe Biden
" Well, it is what it is because he is who he is",Joe Biden
 That’s the problem,Joe Biden
"Donald Trump waved the white flag, surrendered to the virus",Joe Biden
 But the American people don’t give up,Joe Biden
 We don’t give in,Joe Biden
" Unlike Donald Trump, we’re not going to surrender to this virus",Joe Biden
 We’re simply not going to surrender,Joe Biden
" Look, I put in place a plan with this pandemic responsibly",Joe Biden
" I’ve set it up back in May, and then again in June, and in July, the way we can bring this country together around testing, tracing and masking",Joe Biden
 It’s estimated by leading doctors in America that if we just wore these masks for the remainder of this calendar year-,Joe Biden
"For the remainder of this calendar year, we could save up to another 100,000 lives",Joe Biden
 Dr,Joe Biden
" Fauci, who’s been not treated very well by the President, who’s been with three other presidents in the same role, one of the most respected guys in the world, he’s called for a basket mandate",Joe Biden
 This isn’t a political statement of us wearing these masks,Joe Biden
" For God’s sake, it’s a patriotic duty",Joe Biden
"The reason you’re wearing the mask is not to save yourself, but to save your neighbor, the person across from you, the person who you’re next to",Joe Biden
 But still Donald Trump refuses to listen to the science,Joe Biden
 He’s politicized the race for vaccine as well,Joe Biden
" Instead of planning for its safe, equitable, and free distribution, what’s he doing? He’s talking about things that are just not in the rumble possibility, “We’ll have this by September",Joe Biden
 We’ll have it by…” it goes on,Joe Biden
"Look folks, he refused to bring leaders, by the way, of both parties together",Joe Biden
" You know, the House of Representatives, Gwen can tell you, has already passed three major pieces of legislation, two CARES Act, and then the Heroes Act, provides all the money that is necessary to safely open schools and businesses, and do it in a way that they can stay open",Joe Biden
" But it costs money, look at all the people who’ve gone out of business, all of the small businesses",Joe Biden
"We know how to open business, we know what to do it safely, but it costs, to open our schools nationwide, it’s estimated it’ll cost $200 billion to do it safely, to provide everybody with the PPE, [inaudible 00:25:50] everybody, change the ventilation systems, make sure you have separators, make sure you are in a position where we have the sanitary conditions that are wiped down, smaller classes, more teachers",Joe Biden
" But what are we doing? The money’s already been there, they’ve already passed it",Joe Biden
" What’s happened? The President hasn’t got out of his golf bunker in his golf course in the summer, or the bunker in the White House since then to bring people together",Joe Biden
"Look, find anybody Democrat or Republican, who served in the Congress, the Senate, the House, ask them can ever remember a time when there’s been a national crisis, and this is a national crisis, but the President hasn’t brought them all together, and said, “We’re staying here until we fix this",Joe Biden
 We’re going to work it out,Joe Biden
” He hadn’t even talked to y’all,Joe Biden
"Look folks, we’re going to bring the Republicans and Democrats together, and deliver economic relief for working families, and schools, and businesses; I promise you",Joe Biden
 I know how to do this,Joe Biden
" As I said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy",Joe Biden
 I’m going to shut down the virus,Joe Biden
"Look, Donald Trump inherited a strong economy from Barack and me, but he squandered that economy, just like he squatted everything he’s inherited",Joe Biden
" Frankly I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, guys who think they’re better than you because they have a lot of money, look down on you because they live in a better home",Joe Biden
" But tell you what, we understand, we understand how this works",Joe Biden
" Folks, the people who built this country weren’t Wall Street, and investment bankers, and CEOs, they were hard working Americans, middle class folks, working class folks, who built the middle class, and unions built the middle class",Joe Biden
"We know, as Gwen said, we can build back better, with an economy that rewards work not well",Joe Biden
" Right now it rewards wealth, not work",Joe Biden
 We can do without raising taxes on any [inaudible 00:28:10] working person in the middle-class,Joe Biden
" I give you my word as a Biden, if you make less than $400,000, if I’m elected president, you’re not going to see a penny of your taxes go up, not a penny",Joe Biden
"He keeps lying about my plan, but I tell you what, I’m going to ask the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations, by the way 91 of the fortune 500 companies pay no tax at all, zero, zero tax",Joe Biden
 They make billions of dollars,Joe Biden
"Folks, it’s about time people start paying their fair share",Joe Biden
 It’s not a punishment,Joe Biden
 Pay your fair share,Joe Biden
" Why should a firefighter, why should a sheriff, why should a cop, why shouldn’t educator, why should a nurse pay a higher tax rate, which you do, then they pay? You do that, you pay a higher tax rate",Joe Biden
"And by the way, why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump? 750 bucks",Joe Biden
 This guy loves talking about corruption,Joe Biden
 I’ve released 22 years of my tax returns,Joe Biden
 You can go online and see them,Joe Biden
 And guess what? He hadn’t released one single year of his tax returns,Joe Biden
" What the hell was he hiding? What’s in there? Working families and middle-class people, you need help, they need help",Joe Biden
" Particularly first-time home buyers, being able to pay for a healthcare premium, childcare, carefree for your aging loved ones",Joe Biden
"Just to get a new hot water, and I don’t know about you, but the kitchen tables I was raised around, you’re sitting there, and I can hear my dad now, “Well, we can’t get those four new tires, you’re going to have to ride on those bald tires a little while longer till we get by next month; when that hot water heater goes out, what are we going to do?” Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to the community college because you don’t have the money",Joe Biden
" They are the conversations taking place all across America today, and what’s Trump trying to do? Raise your cost for standard of living",Joe Biden
"He’s going to be in the Supreme Court, even if we win, he’ll still be the Supreme Court, in nine days, or 10 days, asking the Supreme Court, with our new justice, who was put on the court for the purpose of destroying the Affordable Care Act, to rip it out root and branch, eliminate it all",Joe Biden
"If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for preexisting conditions, including 2",Joe Biden
"5 million Wisconsinites, 2",Joe Biden
5,Joe Biden
" So if you have diabetes, you ever had cancer, if you had breast… whatever it is, whatever your previous condition, you won’t be able to afford it because they can jack up the price beyond your capacity",Joe Biden
" Women will once again, once again, be charged more for the same health care that a man is charged for just because they’re a woman",Joe Biden
 People forget that that’s what it was before we passed the Affordable Care Act,Joe Biden
"Look, Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege; I think it’s a right people should have",Joe Biden
" If we all get out and vote, we’ll not only restore Obamacare, but we’ll strengthen and build on it",Joe Biden
" So you can keep your private insurance, or you could choose a Medicare-like option that will add to Obamacare, which we tried, which we wanted to do the first time, but couldn’t get the votes",Joe Biden
" We’ll increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles, out of pocket spending, and surprise billings",Joe Biden
And we will reduce the cost of prescriptions by 60%,Joe Biden
 I’m not making that up,Joe Biden
" That comes from saying, we’re going to insist, and we have the votes to do it in this next election, that Medicare can negotiate with the drug companies to say how much they’re going to be willing to pay for whatever drug they have",Joe Biden
" Look, folks, we’re going to make sure we keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions",Joe Biden
"Meanwhile, social security, the actuary of social security has said, if Donald Trump gets reelected, he says he’s going to change social security, based on the changes he wants to make the actuary and social security said, “Social security will be bankrupt by 2023",Joe Biden
"” I’m not making this stuff up, it’s real",Joe Biden
" Folks, I’m going to protect social security, Medicare, and Medicaid",Joe Biden
 And guess what? He’s not going to be able to do it because we’re going to win this election,Joe Biden
"Look, let’s not forget how weak Donald Trump has been, and chaotic",Joe Biden
" He talks about trade policy, my God, what a disaster he’s been",Joe Biden
" Trump’s trade policy has decimated, devastated the Wisconsin dairy industry",Joe Biden
" In 2017 to 2019, Wisconsin lost 15% of its dairy farms, and last year Wisconsin lost more dairy farms in any state in the nation",Joe Biden
" Since the start of the trade war, Wisconsin has seen mass lay off surge by 25%",Joe Biden
" And even before COVID hit, Wisconsin saw big declines in manufacturing jobs",Joe Biden
"After Trump rolled out his irresponsible tax giveaways, Harley Davidson slashed 800 manufacturing jobs, repurchased almost $700 million of its own stock so the corporate heads could get and make a lot more money, and none of it went to the employees, and then shifted some of its production overseas; so much for helping",Joe Biden
"Look, my policies… Right now, by the way, the deficit with China is higher than it was in our administration",Joe Biden
" Look, at the end of the Trump tax loopholes that incentivized companies to ship jobs overseas, these new laws just got passed for real, adds 10%, I’m going to add a 10% surtax to any company to ships jobs overseas",Joe Biden
" And companies that invest and strengthen the American manufacturing, or bring jobs back home, we’re going to offer a 10% tax credit",Joe Biden
"And by the way, the president of United States awards over $600 billion in contracts a year for our military, for all the things we build, federal buildings, well it’s not a violation of any trade law, no one’s done it, but I promise you I’m going to do it; not a single solitary contract will be awarded, unless all the products used by that contractor are made in America, all of them, right here in America",Joe Biden
"And by the way, when I talk about my economic plan, it’s not some liberal think tank that talks about how good it is; Moody’s, a Wall Street major firms pointed out, after looking at my plan for the economy and his, that we will create 18",Joe Biden
"6 million jobs under the Biden plan, a trillion dollars more in GDP than Trump",Joe Biden
" Folks look, the fact is that we’re now in a situation where this President is in a-",Joe Biden
We’re now in a situation where this President is in a position that he doesn’t know what he’s doing,Joe Biden
" If you notice, if you notice what Donald Trump has spent a lot of time doing, he spent a lot of time rolling out irresponsible corporate tax cuts",Joe Biden
" In the meantime, do you realize that during this pandemic, the billionaires in America, billionaires, they’re all listed, have made over $300 billion more? $300 billion more? How about you guys? You’re all doing great, right? You got all that money",Joe Biden
" Look, folks",Joe Biden
 We’re in a situation where the President now finds himself… The thing that bothers me most about all he’s done is the way he talks about our military being suckers and losers,Joe Biden
 Think about this,Joe Biden
 A lot of you women and men served in the military,Joe Biden
 A lot of us [inaudible 00:36:58] served,Joe Biden
 My son Bo gave up the Attorney General’s job in the state of Delaware to volunteer to go to Iraq for a year,Joe Biden
" He won the Bronze Star, the conspicuous service medal",Joe Biden
 He came home with cancer after being near [inaudible 00:00:37:14],Joe Biden
 He came home anyway,Joe Biden
" He was given months to live, and guess what? He wasn’t a loser",Joe Biden
 He wasn’t a sucker,Joe Biden
" He was a patriot, just like your sons and daughters, your parents and grandparents",Joe Biden
" Look, folks",Joe Biden
" If you ever wonder, Trump keeps talking about how strong he is",Joe Biden
 He’s strong and the rest of the nations listen to him,Joe Biden
 Everybody’s afraid of him,Joe Biden
" Well, let me tell you what",Joe Biden
" He’s the first President I’m aware of in American history that six generals, including his former Chief of Staff, six of them left, resigned, and said he wasn’t fit to be Commander in Chief",Joe Biden
"General Stanley McChrystal, Special Operations Commander",Joe Biden
 He’s the guy oversaw the Bin Laden raid,Joe Biden
" Bill McRaven, and 22, he oversaw",Joe Biden
 He was a SEAL,Joe Biden
 He head up the SEALs,Joe Biden
" And 22 4-Stars have endorsed me, saying they trust me to be the next Commander in Chief of the United States Military",Joe Biden
" Folks, it’s about respect",Joe Biden
" It’s about support, and that’s why the Military Times, which his staff tried to wipe out, Military Times just wrote an article saying more active duty troops support Biden than Trump",Joe Biden
 So much for the guy who talks about what a tough guy he is and why everybody listens to him,Joe Biden
" Look, that’s why we have to support the military, and we have to make sure we considerably invest more, which I don’t have to take the time to talk to you tonight about, but invest significantly more in dealing with the Veterans Administration",Joe Biden
"While Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can vote to deliver racial justice",Joe Biden
" Folks, a season of protest has broken out all over this nation, and protesting is not burning and looting and violence, and must never be tolerated and won’t",Joe Biden
 That’s not protesting,Joe Biden
 But those protests are cries for justice,Joe Biden
" The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, they’re not going to soon be forgotten",Joe Biden
" Not by me, not by us, not by this country",Joe Biden
 We have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis as well,Joe Biden
" More frequent, extreme weather",Joe Biden
" Literally, the planet’s at stake",Joe Biden
 We’re told the number of years before it’s irreversible is getting narrower and narrower,Joe Biden
 The West is on fire,Joe Biden

 People are worried what happens if we don’t change this,Joe Biden
" Folks, Donald Trump thinks that when you say climate change, he says hoax",Joe Biden
" Well, this stable genius, as he calls himself, also thinks that wind power causes cancer",Joe Biden
 The way to stop hurricanes coming across the warm Atlantic from Africa is to maybe drop a nuclear bomb on them,Joe Biden
" The same stable genius said the problem we had in the Revolutionary War, we didn’t have enough airports",Joe Biden
" And of the Revolutionary War, God saved the… Anyway",Joe Biden
"Look, when I hear climate change, I think the health of our children, the security of the planet, and I also think it creates jobs",Joe Biden
" Jobs here in Wisconsin, all across the country",Joe Biden
" Folks, combating climate change means saving the planet, protecting our health, and creating millions of good-paying jobs, union jobs right here in Milwaukee and all across America",Joe Biden
" We can change the path we’re on, but we have to act now, because we can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump",Joe Biden
" This election, I promise you, your grandkids are going to write about how it set the path for at least the generation here in America",Joe Biden

" As I said, he’ll not silence the over 85 million people who have already voted",Joe Biden
 They’ve had enough,Joe Biden
" People are coming out in droves, waiting three, four, five, six hours in other states just to vote",Joe Biden

 No matter what he tries,Joe Biden
"And folks, when American’s vote, America will be heard",Joe Biden
" When America’s heard, I believe the message is going to be loud and clear",Joe Biden

 It’s almost criminal the way he has handled it,Joe Biden
"On day one of my presidency I’m going to put in action a plan I’ve been talking about for months, masking, social distancing, testing, tracing, a plan for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics, vaccines, when we get one",Joe Biden
 A plan to address the disproportionate way this virus … vaccines when we get a one,Joe Biden
 A plan to address the disproportionate way this virus has been hitting and devastating the black community across America,Joe Biden
"Folks, every single day we’re seeing race-based disparities in every aspect of this virus",Joe Biden
" Higher infections rates, lower access to testing, harder time quarantining safely, lower access to quality treatment when you become infected, and tragically, higher mortality rates, three times as many African Americans are dying as white Americans … when they get the virus One in 100 Black Americans, excuse me, one in 1,000 Black Americans have died from COVID-19",Joe Biden
" And if we don’t change between now and January, it’s estimated one in 500 by the end of this pandemic",Joe Biden
 That is a mass casualty event in the Black community,Joe Biden
 And it’s totally unnecessary,Joe Biden
 Totally uncalled for,Joe Biden
" My public health plan will ensure the needs of communities that are being hit the hardest by this virus are a priority, not an afterthought",Joe Biden

I mean it,Joe Biden
 It’s not just talk,Joe Biden
 I mean it,Joe Biden
 We’re going to have to deliver racial justice in America,Joe Biden
 I see in all the protests here in Philadelphia and across the country a cry for justice,Joe Biden

 They’re inspiring a new wave of justice in America,Joe Biden
" And George Floyd’s little girl, six years old, said to me when I went to be with the family … I knelt down to say hi to her and she looked at me and she said, “Daddy is going to change the world",Joe Biden

” Rapist Mexicans,Joe Biden
 He put a ban on all Muslims coming to the United States,Joe Biden
 And the way he talked about the African-American community,Joe Biden
 The way he talked about the Hispanic community,Joe Biden

 Being with you all reminds me of that gospel hymn that inspired so many of us,Joe Biden

"Folks, folks, you know I’ve been doing this awhile",Joe Biden
 One of the reasons I got elected in the first place in Delaware across the line was because of the folks in Pennsylvania,Joe Biden
" All the media and Pennsylvania, all the media in Delaware for the first 25 years of my career was all Philadelphia television",Joe Biden
 There wasn’t no Delaware television,Joe Biden
 And I was very happy to have the moniker of being known as Pennsylvania’s third Senator,Joe Biden
 I know Philadelphia well,Joe Biden
" I married a Philly girl, by the way",Joe Biden
" And by the way, I got my Eagles jacket on",Joe Biden
"Folks, here’s what I want to say and I’ll conclude",Joe Biden
 You’ve been here a long time,Joe Biden
 I’ll never forget when President John F,Joe Biden
" Kennedy said, when he promised that we’re going to go to the moon",Joe Biden
" He said, he said words and my colleagues in the senate always used to kid me for repeating",Joe Biden
" He said, “We’re doing it because we Americans, we refuse to postpone",Joe Biden
"” Well, I refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities available to the American people",Joe Biden
 I refuse to postpone what we can do,Joe Biden
 There’s nothing beyond the capacity of the United States of America,Joe Biden
 Nothing,Joe Biden
 There’s no limit to America’s future,Joe Biden
 The blinders have been taken off,Joe Biden
 The only thing could tear America part is America itself,Joe Biden
" And that’s exactly what Trump’s been trying to do from the very beginning, dividing America based on race, religion, gender, national origin",Joe Biden
 It’s wrong,Joe Biden
 It’s not who we are,Joe Biden
 This is not who we are,Joe Biden
 Everybody knows who Donald Trump is,Joe Biden
 Let’s keep showing them who we are,Joe Biden
"Folks, and I mean this, this is not just campaign rhetoric",Joe Biden
 We choose hope over fear,Joe Biden
 We choose unity over division,Joe Biden

S,Joe Biden
" Senator, you’re not going to forget where you came from and who you are",Joe Biden
Your values are baked in,Joe Biden
 They’re Iowa values,Joe Biden
 They’re American values,Joe Biden
" You value honor, decency, respect, and dignity",Joe Biden
 You know they all matter,Joe Biden
 They matter a lot,Joe Biden
 That’s who we are,Joe Biden
" And as we saw in the debate, where a farmer’s daughter knows a breakeven point for a price of corn, crops",Joe Biden
 You think that’d be fairly basic,Joe Biden
 That’s like my not knowing where the Delaware River was back home,Joe Biden
" Folks, but there’s something else",Joe Biden
 Theresa and I both lost our first spouses,Joe Biden
 We’ve both been single parents with young kids,Joe Biden
 We both found a way back from broken places,Joe Biden

" She sees, she understands, she believes",Joe Biden
" When she talks to you, when you talk to her, you know, and I’m not just saying this, you know she understands, she gets it",Joe Biden
Just like our good friend Tom Harkin was your Senator,Joe Biden
 Teresa will be your Senator for Iowa,Joe Biden

" Folks, only four days left",Joe Biden
 Millions of Americans are already voting,Joe Biden

 Right here in Iowa with all of you in the final days,Joe Biden
 Please keep your sense of empowerment,Joe Biden
" Keep your sense of optimism of what we can do together, because you know we can do anything",Joe Biden
 You know how I know how hard it is,Joe Biden
" More than 200, and now I think it’s up to 30,000 people have died, Americans dead, because COVID-19",Joe Biden
"Nearly 1,700 dead right here in Iowa",Joe Biden
 Iowa hit a record number of daily cases yesterday,Joe Biden
" It was over 2,300, and a record number of hospitalizations, more than 600",Joe Biden
" We’ve now hit nine million cases nationwide, a tragic milestone",Joe Biden
" And millions of people are out of work, on the edge, and they can’t see the light",Joe Biden
 They don’t know,Joe Biden
 It just looks dark right now for them,Joe Biden
" 82,000 Iowa jobs lost in this pandemic and still they’ve not come back",Joe Biden
" 70,000 jobs lost in Iowa since Donald Trump became President",Joe Biden
" Here at the fairgrounds, the Iowa State Fair canceled for the first time since World War Two, and Donald Trump has given up",Joe Biden
 The White House Chief of Staff said it out loud last week,Joe Biden
" He said, “We’re not going to control the pandemic",Joe Biden
 We’re not going to control the pandemic,Joe Biden
"” In the debate last week with Donald Trump, he said, “We’re rounding the corner",Joe Biden
 It’s going away,Joe Biden
"” And only he could say, “We’re learning to live with it",Joe Biden
"” Well, maybe you remember what I told him, “We’re not learning to live with it",Joe Biden
 We’re having to learn to die with it because of you,Joe Biden
” Donald Trump has waved the white flag,Joe Biden
 He surrendered to this virus,Joe Biden
 But the American people don’t give up,Joe Biden
" Remember what he said when he did that interview, he said, although he knew about the crisis, he knew how bad it was back in January, the end of January, he decided not to tell the people, because he worried there would panic",Joe Biden
" Well, guess what? We don’t panic",Joe Biden
 He panicked,Joe Biden
 And he misrepresented to us,Joe Biden
 Imagine if you had told us in January how dangerous this was and took action,Joe Biden
" It’s estimated there would be over 130,000 people still alive",Joe Biden
"By the way, we don’t cower",Joe Biden
 Nor do I and never will we,Joe Biden
" Unlike Donald Trump, we will not surrender to this virus",Joe Biden
" I’m going to put in place a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly, which I laid out back in March, bringing the country together around testing, tracing, masking",Joe Biden
" It’s estimated by the leading doctors in America that if you just wore those masks for the next between now and the end of the year, we would save, just putting this mask on, we’d saved 100,000 lives",Joe Biden
" It’s expected that 200,000 more lives will pass between having the end of the year",Joe Biden
 Dr,Joe Biden
 Fauci called last week for a mask mandate,Joe Biden
 This isn’t a political statement,Joe Biden
" It’s patriotic duty, for God’s sake",Joe Biden
" But still, Donald Trump refuses to listen to science",Joe Biden
 He politicizes the race for a vaccine instead of planning for its safe and equitable and free distribution,Joe Biden
 He refused to provide schools and small businesses the resources and national standards where they can open safely and stay open,Joe Biden
" Well, I’m going to bring together Republicans and Democrats to deliver economic relief to working families and school …",Joe Biden
… together Republicans and Democrats to deliver economic relief to working families and schools and businesses,Joe Biden
 The Congress has already passed this legislation,Joe Biden
" It’s sitting there, but he refused, he spent all his time this summer in his golf course bunkers or down in the white house bunkers, think about it",Joe Biden
" I’ve been around for a while, I bet even Senator Grassley would have to acknowledge that I don’t ever remember any President in a crisis where there’s a disagreement in the house and the Senate between Democrats and Republicans, didn’t even try to bring them together to deal with this",Joe Biden
" The house back in May passed the Heroes Act, which would allow businesses and schools to open safely because it costs money, you need sanitation, you need ventilation, you need masking, you need distancing, you need separators",Joe Biden
" It all costs money, but it’s sad, one in six businesses are now out of business, because he won’t act",Joe Biden
" I’ve said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy, I’m going to shut down the virus",Joe Biden
"Even before the virus Donald Trump had already blown it, he inherited a strong economy from Barack and me, well like everything else he inherited, he squandered it",Joe Biden
" He squandered it, frankly",Joe Biden
" I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, so have you",Joe Biden
" Guys who think because they have a lot more money that they’re better than you, look down on you",Joe Biden
" I know, I acknowledge I got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder coming from an Irish Catholic neighborhood where it wasn’t viewed as that being such a great thing",Joe Biden
" When I read something about how if I’m elected President, I’m going to be the first non-Ivy league person to occupy the white house in a long time",Joe Biden
" Well guess what? Like somehow, I didn’t belong if I didn’t go to the Ivy league",Joe Biden
" Look, I’ll say it about time, it’s about time that a guy or woman or graduate from a state university is able to sit in the oval office",Joe Biden
"Because if I’m sitting there, you will be too, you know who really built this country? It wasn’t Wall Street, it wasn’t CEO’s, it was hard working folks like all of you who built the middle class and unions helped build the middle class",Joe Biden
" We know how we can build a back and build it back better with an economy that rewards work for a change, not wealth",Joe Biden
 We can do it without raising the penny tax on the middle class,Joe Biden
" I guarantee you, give you my word as a Biden no one making less than $400,000 year will see a penny in their taxes raised, no one, but I tell you what, it’s about time",Joe Biden
" The wealthiest people in America, the billionaires, the trillionaires, the multi-billionaires and the biggest corporations start paying their fair share",Joe Biden
" 91 major corporations out of the Fortune 500 didn’t pay a penny in tax last year, that’s tens of billions of dollars",Joe Biden
 They’re going to pay their fair share,Joe Biden
"Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse, a cop pay a higher tax rate, which you do than a major multi-billion dollar corporation",Joe Biden
" Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump who paid $750? You want to know everything I don’t like about Trump? Let me tell you, I could capture it in one answer he gave",Joe Biden
" He was asked last time out about paying so little taxes, allegedly being a billionaire, know what he said? He says, “Because I’m smarter, I know how to game the system",Joe Biden
"” But he ain’t going to be gaming the system anymore in the Biden administration, they’re going to start paying",Joe Biden
" And we’re going to deliver tax relief for working families, the middle class to help you buy your first home, pay for healthcare premiums or childcare or care for an aging loved one, or being able to pay off your student debt for God’s sake",Joe Biden
" Look, where I come from it’s just about being fair",Joe Biden
" We’re not asking anybody to do any more than anybody else just be fair, decent",Joe Biden
"Trump got a Supreme Court Justice for overwhelming reason, by the way, never before has there ever been a hearing on a Supreme Court Justice once an election began",Joe Biden
" That’s never occurred, but you got his justice for one simple reason to destroy the Affordable Care Act",Joe Biden
" He’d been trying since the day he got elected, and if they get their way, $100 million people will lose protection for pre-existing conditions, including 1",Joe Biden
3 million Iowans will lose it,Joe Biden
 Complications of COVID-19 are going to become the next preexisting condition,Joe Biden
" Allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, delay your coverage and a lot of young people don’t realize this, but before Obamacare insurance companies charged women more for the same healthcare they charge men because they could, that’ll end",Joe Biden
" Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege, I think it’s a right",Joe Biden
 We all get out and vote,Joe Biden
" And by the way, they’re going to court in 10 days, 10 days, as he said to wipe it all out, end it, all of it",Joe Biden
"Well, I’ll restore the Affordable Care Act and I’ll strengthen and build on it, so you can keep your private insurance if you like it, or choose a Medicare like public option",Joe Biden
" We’re going to increase subsidies for lower premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, surprise billing",Joe Biden
" As Theresa said, this time, we are going to make sure Medicare can negotiate with the drug companies for prices reducing them by 60%",Joe Biden
 I promise you we’ll get that done,Joe Biden
 We’re going to make sure we keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions,Joe Biden
" Remember what he said when he talked about the people who were dying and not dying, he said, “Virtually,” this is a quote from Trump, “virtually nobody’s dying, except for people over 65 with heart conditions,” like they’re disposable",Joe Biden
 It doesn’t matter with this guy,Joe Biden
" No, I’m not joking",Joe Biden
" Think about it, think about it",Joe Biden
" And then when he was told for the first time like we did today, 1,000 deaths a day, remember what his comment was? He said, “It is what it is",Joe Biden
"” Well it is what it is because he is who he is, that’s why it is what it is",Joe Biden
" These guys are something else, man",Joe Biden
" And meanwhile, the actuary at the Social Security Department says if Donald Trump gets what he’s saying, he said, “You reelect me I’m going to change social security",Joe Biden
"” The actuary says, “If the change occurs that he is promoting, it will bankrupt social security by 2023",Joe Biden
"” Go home and tell your parents or grandparents that, that’s a fact",Joe Biden
" Theresa said I’ll protect social, security, Medicare, Medicaid",Joe Biden
 And let’s not forget how Donald Trump weak and chaotic China trade policy has cost farmers and manufacturing so badly,Joe Biden
 Agricultural exports to China during the Trump years have been 40% lower than during the Obama Biden second term,Joe Biden
" On his watch and this really bugs me, on his watch ethanol margins have tanked and Iowa’s manufacturing facilities are idle and even closing",Joe Biden
" He even says, I love this quote from him",Joe Biden
" He says, because of his bailouts, “Our farmers do better now than when they actually had a farm",Joe Biden
” I’m going to read that again,Joe Biden
 “Our farmers are actually doing better now than when they actually had a farm,Joe Biden
” Where’s this guy from? Who does he think he is?,Joe Biden
"Look, I’ll do what he’s been unable to do, I’ll mobilize a true international effort to stop China’s abuses so we can strengthen manufacturing and farming in Iowa and across the country",Joe Biden
" I’m going to hold China accountable, which he hasn’t from the pandemic on",Joe Biden
 Folks,Joe Biden
 But there’s nothing worse in my view than the way he has spoken about those who served in uniform,Joe Biden
 He called them losers and suckers,Joe Biden
" My son, Beau, many of you knew volunteered to serve a year in Iraq, gave up the Attorney General’s job to do it",Joe Biden
" Won the bronze star, the Conspicuous Service Metal and other awards, he was neither a loser or a sucker, he was a Patriot",Joe Biden
" And Theresa, so is your son Dane, who was in the army, he’s a Patriot like all of your sons, daughters, and all of those of you who have served",Joe Biden
"It’s no wonder that the six top generals in the President’s administration left and said, “He does not deserve to be commander in chief,” his own generals in his own administration",Joe Biden
" No President has ever had that happen, none",Joe Biden
" And that’s why Special Forces Commander, Stanley McChrystal, general and the head of the Navy Seals, Admiral Craven, along with 20 other four star generals endorsed me saying they’d be proud to have me as commander in chief",Joe Biden
 A sitting President,Joe Biden
 And that’s why the Military Times quotes more troops would vote for Biden then Trump,Joe Biden
" Folks, it’s not about me, it’s about him",Joe Biden
 That’s why we have to support our military,Joe Biden
" You vote for me, you’re voting for them",Joe Biden
 And while Donald Trump fails to condemn White supremacy …,Joe Biden
"And while Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can vote to deliver racial justice",Joe Biden
 A season of protest has broken out all across America,Joe Biden
" And by the way, legitimate protesting is not burning or looting",Joe Biden
 Violence can never be tolerated and it won’t,Joe Biden
" But those protests are cries for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake",Joe Biden
" They’ll not soon be forgotten, not by me, not by us, or not by this country",Joe Biden
"Folks, we ave to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis as well",Joe Biden
" More frequent, extreme weather",Joe Biden
 The West is on fire,Joe Biden
" We’ve lost more forest than the total space of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, in the West",Joe Biden
 The Midwest I need not tell you is flooding,Joe Biden
" You know here in Iowa, the derecho, catastrophic floods and droughts that lay waste to lives, livelihoods and whole communities",Joe Biden
 And in the South and the East hurricanes are more severe,Joe Biden
 Oceans are rising,Joe Biden
 My state’s only three feet above sea level,Joe Biden
 People are already talking about the change we have to make,Joe Biden
 We don’t have a lot of time,Joe Biden
" Donald Trump, when you say climate change, he thinks hoax, and that stable genius, as he calls himself, continues to say wind power causes cancer",Joe Biden
" It’s the same guy who said, by the way you think I’m making this up, when he was advised about the increasing hurricanes coming across the Atlantic because of the warm water, he said, “Maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them",Joe Biden
” Holy mackerel,Joe Biden
"This also a guy you may recall, the stable genius, he said, “The problem with the revolutionary war was we didn’t have enough airports",Joe Biden
” And he talks about mental acuity? Whoa,Joe Biden
" Folks, you look at climate warming",Joe Biden
 You look at it the way I do,Joe Biden
" Creates jobs, Iowa jobs, jobs across America",Joe Biden
 You understand that here in Iowa we’ve already created thousands of good paying jobs because of your dominant in wind energy,Joe Biden
 And it’s expected that the number of wind jobs will double or triple by 2030 in Iowa,Joe Biden
 And notwithstanding that the stable genius says wind power causes cancer,Joe Biden
" Wind power helps save the planet, generates millions of dollars in economic growth, and provides good prevailing wage jobs",Joe Biden
"Folks, combating climate change means saving the planet, protecting our health, and creating millions of good paying jobs, Union jobs, in wind and solar and carbon capture",Joe Biden
" Iowa farmers were the first in the world to be in a position where they reach net zero emissions, because we’re going to make sure there’s a whole lot more land set aside and you get paid for it",Joe Biden
" Deep rooted products, emissions, reward them",Joe Biden
" Folks, we can do this",Joe Biden
 There’s nothing beyond our capacity,Joe Biden
 So honk if you want America to lead again,Joe Biden
 Honk if you want America to trust each other again,Joe Biden
 Honk if you want America to be united again,Joe Biden
"Folks, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump",Joe Biden
" In 2008 and 2012 you placed your trust in Barack Obama and me and we worked for you, for the entire country",Joe Biden
" Well, I’ll do it again in 2020",Joe Biden
" My campaign is a broad coalition, welcomes Democrats, Republicans, and Independents",Joe Biden
" I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president",Joe Biden
 I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do,Joe Biden
" In my administration, they’ll be no red states or blue states, just the United States of America",Joe Biden
"Folks, I mean this at the bottom of my heart",Joe Biden
" That’s the job of a president, a duty to care, to care for everyone, to heal",Joe Biden
" And you too have a sacred duty, a duty to vote",Joe Biden
 It matters,Joe Biden

"Folks, this president has done everything to try to discourage us, to try to convince us that it doesn’t matter, all about illegal voting, all the stuff he’s putting up, but guess what? He will not be able to stop us at all",Joe Biden
" Despite Trump’s efforts, a recent press article two days ago said never before “in modern presidential politics has a candidate had been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to repress the vote as Trump",Joe Biden
” End of quote,Joe Biden
 We will not be silenced,Joe Biden
 85 million people have already voted so far,Joe Biden
 We’ve had enough,Joe Biden
"Folks, look, I’ll never forget as a kid, the words of President Kennedy about going to the moon",Joe Biden
" He used the phrase, he said, we’re doing it because, ” We refuse to postpone, or I refuse to postpone, incredible opportunities available to the American people",Joe Biden
” There’s nothing beyond our capacity,Joe Biden
 There is no limit to our future,Joe Biden
" The only thing that can’t tear America, look, I’ll talk about how we’re in trouble",Joe Biden
" Well, nothing can tear America part, except America itself",Joe Biden
 And that’s exactly what Donald Trump is doing from the beginning,Joe Biden
" Trying to divide America, pitting Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin",Joe Biden
 It’s wrong,Joe Biden
 That’s not who we are,Joe Biden
"Look, folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is",Joe Biden
 We got to let him know who we are,Joe Biden
 We choose hope over fear,Joe Biden
" We choose unity over division, science over fiction",Joe Biden

" Turned abandoned buildings and dangerous lots into places of life and hope, making sure that bringing the community together to build homes for local families and helping young people around Tampa learn job skills, instill pride and purpose in neighborhoods that have been left behind, and laying the groundwork for economic opportunity that endures through generations",Joe Biden

" I’m getting confused here, man",Joe Biden
" Millions of Americans have already voted, over 75 I’m told",Joe Biden
 75 million and millions more are going to vote before this is over,Joe Biden
" And I believe when you use your power, the power of the vote, we literally are going to change the course of this country for generations to come",Joe Biden
We’re going to do it both at home and abroad right here in Florida with all of you,Joe Biden
 You’re the ones who built this country,Joe Biden
 CEOs and Wall Street didn’t build this country,Joe Biden
 You did,Joe Biden
" No, not a joke",Joe Biden
 I’ve been saying this for years,Joe Biden
" Middle class people did, hardworking folks and unions built the middle class I might add",Joe Biden
 And you’re the ones who are going to save this country,Joe Biden
"Look, I said, I got in this race for three reasons a year ago, little over a year, and I meant it",Joe Biden
 The first was to restore the soul of this country,Joe Biden
" This is not who we are, is not who we are",Joe Biden
" We’re more decent, honorable",Joe Biden
 We’re more respectful,Joe Biden
 We’re better people than we’ve been seen from this administration,Joe Biden
" Second reason was to restore the backbone of this country, the middle class and bring everybody along this time",Joe Biden
" And thirdly, to unite this country",Joe Biden
 We have to unite us,Joe Biden
" These final days, keep that sense of empowerment with you",Joe Biden
" That sense of optimism, what we can do, what we can overcome",Joe Biden
 That’s the God’s truth,Joe Biden
 I’ve never been more optimistic about America and America’s chances than I am today,Joe Biden
 Because I know the American people,Joe Biden
 I know who we are,Joe Biden
" We have never, ever, ever, ever let the country down and give it a chance",Joe Biden
" And on November 3rd, we’re going to unite this country and show the world who American really is",Joe Biden
I mean it,Joe Biden
 I know it’s hard,Joe Biden
" Over these past few months has been so much pain, so much suffering, so much-",Joe Biden
"So much pain, so much suffering, so much loss in America",Joe Biden
" More than 225,000 people dead, 225,000",Joe Biden
" The estimates are, if we’d have acted responsibly, there’d be 160,000 fewer dead than there are today, because of COVID-19",Joe Biden
 We’re now past the nine million mark of people infected,Joe Biden
" More than 16,000 people in Florida have been lost, and millions of people are out of work, on the edge",Joe Biden
 They can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel,Joe Biden
" It’s like that old bad joke of my generation, it’s a freight train, because that’s what happens if he stays in office",Joe Biden
 Donald Trump has given up,Joe Biden
" Over the weekend, the White House Chief of Staff said, and I’m quoting, “We’re not going to control the pandemic",Joe Biden
” It’s obvious he’s not,Joe Biden
"At the debate last week with Trump, he said, “We’re rounding the corner",Joe Biden
 It’s going away,Joe Biden
 We’re learning to live with it,Joe Biden
” Remember what I told him? He’s asking us to learn to die with it,Joe Biden
 That’s what’s happening,Joe Biden
" Donald Trump has waved the white flag, abandoned our families and surrendered to this virus",Joe Biden
" But the American people never give up, we never give in, and we surely don’t cower",Joe Biden
 And neither will I,Joe Biden
 Donald Trump just had a super spreader event here again,Joe Biden
 They’re spreading more than just coronavirus,Joe Biden
 He’s spreading division and discord,Joe Biden
" We need a President that’s going to bring us together, not pull us apart",Joe Biden
" I’ll put a plan in place to deal with this pandemic responsibly, bringing the country together around testing, tracing, masking",Joe Biden
" Leading doctors in America, including Trump’s own CDC Director and Dr",Joe Biden
" Fauci last week said that if we just wore a mask, between now and the end of the year, we’d save 100,000 lives",Joe Biden
"Folks, that’s not a political statement",Joe Biden
" It’s a patriotic duty, for God’s sake",Joe Biden
 But still Donald Trump refuses to listen to science,Joe Biden
 And we shouldn’t be politicizing the race for a vaccine,Joe Biden
" We should be planning for its safe use and free and equitable distribution, providing PPE for national standards for school, businesses to open safely",Joe Biden
" I laid out a plan back in May how to do that, bringing together Republicans and Democrats to deliver economic relief",Joe Biden
" That’s already passed by the Democratic House of Representatives for working families, for schools and businesses",Joe Biden
" I’ve said it before, I’m not going to shut down the economy",Joe Biden
 I’m not going to shut down the country,Joe Biden
 I’m going to shut down the virus,Joe Biden
"Donald Trump inherited a strong economy from Barack and me, just like he inherited everything in his life",Joe Biden
" Oh, it’s a fact",Joe Biden
 He squandered that economy like he squandered everything else,Joe Biden
" But folks, I promise you, I guarantee you, we can build back and build back better with an economy that rewards work not wealth, and we can do it without raising taxes a single solitary penny from working class or middle class families",Joe Biden
" I guarantee you, my word as a Biden, no one making less than $ 400,000 will pay a single penny more in taxes",Joe Biden
 Not a penny,Joe Biden
" But I tell you what I’m going to do, and I make no apologies for it, I’m going to ask the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations of the Fortune 500 companies, 91 making a collective billions of dollars, didn’t pay a single solitary penny in federal tax",Joe Biden
" Well, I’m going to make sure they pay their fair share",Joe Biden
"Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse pay at a higher rate than the super wealthy or corporate America? Because you do, you do",Joe Biden
" Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump pays? If we made this as a movie 10 years ago, people would think we’re making it up",Joe Biden
 But it’s true,Joe Biden
" We’re going to deliver tax relief for working families of the middle class to help you buy your first home, help you pay for health care premiums, for childcare, for caring for your aging loved ones, for eliminating college debt",Joe Biden
 We’re going to take care of this,Joe Biden
 And we can afford it,Joe Biden
" Look, Trump got his Supreme Court Justice, and he did it for one overwhelming reason, something he’s been trying to do since the day he got elected, to destroy the Affordable Care Act",Joe Biden
 He’s going at it again,Joe Biden
" If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for pre-existing conditions, cancer, all diseases that are out there",Joe Biden
"Folks, look, 8",Joe Biden
4 million Floridians have pre-existing conditions,Joe Biden
" Complications of COVID-19 will become the next pre-existing condition, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, deny your coverage",Joe Biden
" A lot of you young people don’t even realize it, but before we passed the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies charged women more for the same healthcare as men, just because they were women",Joe Biden
" Fact, Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege",Joe Biden
 I think it’s you’re right,Joe Biden
" If we all get out and vote, we’ll not only restore Obamacare, we’ll strengthen and build on it, so you can keep your private insurance if you like it, and you can choose a Medicare like option if you don’t",Joe Biden
" We’re going to increase subsidies and lower your payments and deductibles and premiums, out-of-pocket spending, reduce the unknown billing, reduce prescription drug costs by, according to the experts, up to 60%, by allowing, not making this stuff up, by allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices",Joe Biden
We’re going to make sure you keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions,Joe Biden
" We’re going to protect social security and Medicare, which they’ve been trying to cut for years",Joe Biden
" Meanwhile, the social security actuary, the guy who runs it, says the plan like Donald Trump says he wants to institute if he gets reelected, he says will bankrupt social security by 2023",Joe Biden
" As my wife would say, “Google it",Joe Biden
” You’ll see what I’m telling you,Joe Biden
" You’ve got that right, pal",Joe Biden
" He said, “Trump is bankrupt",Joe Biden
"” By the way, he probably is",Joe Biden
 He owes $400 million to somebody,Joe Biden
" Anyway, folks, we have to vote",Joe Biden
 We have to vote for our military families,Joe Biden
" No, not a joke",Joe Biden
" Folks, of all the things Donald Trump has said, nothing has bothered me worse than the way he’s spoken to those who served in uniform",Joe Biden
 He called them losers and suckers,Joe Biden
Losers and suckers,Joe Biden
" My deceased son, Beau Biden won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal and other awards",Joe Biden
" Volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, gave up his attorney general job to go with his unit",Joe Biden
" He wasn’t a sucker, or a loser",Joe Biden
 He was a patriot,Joe Biden
 Like all of you who served,Joe Biden
" Like your sons, your daughters, your parents, and your grandparents",Joe Biden
" We have to vote for their dignity, respect they are due",Joe Biden
" We have to vote because while Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can deliver racial justice while he’s trying to make it worse",Joe Biden
" Look, Donald Trump doesn’t believe that systemic racism is a problem",Joe Biden
 He won’t say black lives matter,Joe Biden
 We know they matter,Joe Biden
 That’s why a season of protest has broken out across the nation,Joe Biden
" But by the way, protesting is not burning or looting",Joe Biden
" Violence must never be a tactic tolerated, and it won’t",Joe Biden
 But these protestors are in a cry for justice,Joe Biden
" The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten",Joe Biden
" Not by me, not by us, not by this country",Joe Biden
" When I met with the family, his little daughter said, looked at me and she’s only about seven years, and I knelt down to talk to her and the family",Joe Biden
" She looked at me, and she said, “Mr",Joe Biden
" Vice President, my daddy is changing the world",Joe Biden
"” Well guess what? The inspiration coming from her daddy would happen, this new wave of justice in America",Joe Biden
 But true justice is also more than just dealing with abuse,Joe Biden
 It’s about economic justice,Joe Biden
" It’s about schools, housing, access to capital, good paying jobs, a minimum wage of a minimum of $15 an hour",Joe Biden
 Financial stability,Joe Biden
" Giving families of color a real shot to own their own home, start a small business, send a child to college debt-free, so we can build wealth and pass on opportunities through generations like we did like, so many middle-class families have in the past",Joe Biden
 But we have to vote to ensure the full promise of this country,Joe Biden
 We have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis,Joe Biden
" Because you know in Florida, it is a crisis",Joe Biden
We’re all seeing the impact more than most,Joe Biden
 Devastating hurricanes to lay waste to all communities,Joe Biden
" Economic toll is astounding, and it grows every year, but the human toll is worse",Joe Biden
" Lost lives, lost homes, small businesses shattered",Joe Biden
" First responders put at risk from the West Coast burning, the middle part of the country flooding",Joe Biden
" Donald Trump when he thinks of climate change, he says hoax",Joe Biden
" Well, guess what? Speaking of hoaxes, remember what he said about these increasing violent hurricanes and the frequency? He actually said, maybe we should detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic",Joe Biden
" By the way, the same stable genius who said, the biggest problem we had in the revolutionary war is we didn’t have enough airports",Joe Biden
 Whoa,Joe Biden
" Man, I tell you, what",Joe Biden
" His answer to families in Puerto Rico, struggling through Hurricane Maria was, what would he do? Toss rolls of paper towels at them",Joe Biden
 He doesn’t have any real answers,Joe Biden
 We know we can do something about it while combating climate change means jobs,Joe Biden
" We can unleash American ingenuity and manufacturing and build a stronger, more climate-resistant nation, creating millions of new high paying jobs",Joe Biden
We can change the path we’re on,Joe Biden
 We’ve got to act now,Joe Biden
 Time is running out,Joe Biden
" This country can’t afford four more years of Trump, who thinks he’s only responsible to the people who voted for him",Joe Biden
 I don’t see the presidency that way,Joe Biden
 I see an American as an American,Joe Biden
 I’d run as a proud Democrat,Joe Biden
" But guess what? It’s starting to rain, and I’m going to shorten this for y’all",Joe Biden
 I don’t see America that way,Joe Biden
" In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in Barack and me",Joe Biden
" Well guess what? Each day we were in office, we worked for you, the entire country",Joe Biden
" It was never about red States or blue States, always about the United States of America",Joe Biden
 I was reminded of that last month when I visited Gettysburg,Joe Biden
"Folks, you know what? When I went to Gettysburg to make that speech, Abraham Lincoln said a house divided cannot stand",Joe Biden
" Well, a nation divided cannot stand",Joe Biden
 I was reminded of that earlier this week,Joe Biden
" Ladies and gentlemen, you got to go to, IWillVote",Joe Biden
com/FLA,Joe Biden
 Become FL,Joe Biden
 Return your ballot today,Joe Biden
 I never forgot what President Kennedy said about going to the moon,Joe Biden
" He said, “We’re going, you know why? Because we refuse to postpone",Joe Biden
” Let’s not postpone and get out of the rain,Joe Biden
 God bless you all,Joe Biden
 Thank you,Joe Biden
Thank you for that incredible introduction,Joe Biden
 My name is Joe Biden,Joe Biden
" I’m Jill Biden’s husband, and I am Kamala’s running mate",Joe Biden
" You all think I’m kidding, don’t you? Folks, it gives me so much more optimism about the future to see that Maya and so many inspiring young people like Maya… That’s President Trump",Joe Biden
 He’s having trouble being heard over there,Joe Biden
 They’re a very polite bunch,Joe Biden
"Look folks, I think Maya, you’re inspiring and so many young people like you I’ve met all across America are getting so deeply involved, helping create the change that you know is possible",Joe Biden
 And of course I know you’ve had an incredible role model in Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms,Joe Biden
" I tell you what, she is something else",Joe Biden
" First of all, two things you got to know about her when you meet her",Joe Biden
" Number one, understand she’s smarter than you",Joe Biden
 That’s the first thing I had to learn,Joe Biden
" And the second thing is she’s got a backbone a ramrod, and she has a moral compass that’s true North",Joe Biden
 I really admire her,Joe Biden
 You’ve done an incredible job mayor,Joe Biden
 You’re a powerhouse of a leader and you’ve helped shape and support this campaign from the earliest days,Joe Biden
" So, I want to thank you, Mayor Bottoms, for your vision, your partnership, and your commitment to the campaign and the people of Atlanta",Joe Biden
And thank you Common and Offset,Joe Biden
" I tell you what, I know that’s the real reason you came, the entertainment",Joe Biden
 I don’t blame you,Joe Biden
" But I tell you what, great to meet them both and for them energizing and sharing their message of hope with all of us",Joe Biden
I also want to recognize the elected officials joining us today,Joe Biden
" Representative Billy Mitchell, representative Calvin Smyre, who have been with us from the very beginning of this campaign",Joe Biden
" And we got to send back to the United States House of Representatives, Lucy and Hank and Stanford",Joe Biden
 All three of them are first rate congresspersons because if I win I’m going to need them badly,Joe Biden
" And by the way, [Nikema 00:03:13], I think it’s important that you win as well along with Carolyn Bourdeaux",Joe Biden
"Folks, I think we’re going to surprise the living devil out of everybody this year",Joe Biden
 I can’t tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate,Joe Biden
 There’s no state more consequential than Georgia in that fight,Joe Biden
 You have two competitive races here at stake,Joe Biden
 You have two great candidates that are going to need all the support they can get,Joe Biden
" Reverend Warnock and Jon Ossoff, both great candidates",Joe Biden
" No, they really are",Joe Biden
" And by the way, if we had told you all a year ago or told those guys out in the street a year ago, good to see you man, told all those guys out in the street there a year ago, how competitive Georgia was going to be, you would have all looked at one another like you’re crazy",Joe Biden
" But look, it doesn’t take long for people to figure out when the game is up",Joe Biden
" When the Carney show goes through town the first time and people find out there’s no P under any one of the three shells, the next time it comes back, it doesn’t get much attention",Joe Biden
" Well, that’s what the Trump administration has done",Joe Biden
"Let’s give the people of Georgia to new senators who will fight for your interests, not for Donald Trump’s interest",Joe Biden
 And not continue as for doing others have to make fun of my running mate,Joe Biden
 I love how these guys try to degrade everything and everybody,Joe Biden
 It’s got to stop and it’s going to stop with us,Joe Biden
" Folks, it’s go time",Joe Biden
 There’s one week left,Joe Biden
" Millions of Americans, over 60 million Americans have all ready voted and millions more by the end of this week",Joe Biden
" I believe when you use your power, the power to vote will change the course of this country",Joe Biden
" Right here in Georgia, with all of you, these are the final days, so keep that sense of empowerment with you",Joe Biden
 That sense of optimism,Joe Biden
 What we can do,Joe Biden
 What we will do,Joe Biden
 What we can overcome,Joe Biden
 What we will overcome,Joe Biden
"Look folks, I’ve been around a while, but I’ve never been more optimistic about America or the American people than I am right today",Joe Biden
 But I know it’s hard,Joe Biden
" Over the past few months, there’s been so much pain, so much suffering, so much loss in America",Joe Biden
" More than 225,000 dead Americans because of COVID-19",Joe Biden
" 7,800 right here in Georgia",Joe Biden
 Millions of people are out of work on the edge,Joe Biden
 They can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel,Joe Biden
 And Donald Trump has given up,Joe Biden
" Over the weekend, his chief of staff of the White House said, I quote, “We’re not going to control the pandemic",Joe Biden
"” At the debate last week, Donald Trump looked at me and said, “We’re rounding the corner",Joe Biden
"” As my grandfather would say, “He’s rounding the bend",Joe Biden
”,Joe Biden
"He said, “It’s going to go away",Joe Biden
 We’re learning to live with it,Joe Biden
"” I told him, “We’re not learning to live with it if you’re asking people to learn to die with it",Joe Biden
 And it’s wrong,Joe Biden
"” Donald Trump has waved the white flag, abandoned our families and surrendered to this virus",Joe Biden
 But the American people don’t give up,Joe Biden
 They don’t give in and surely they don’t cower and neither will I,Joe Biden
" I will put in place a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly, bringing this country together with testing, tracing, masking",Joe Biden
" It’s estimated that if we wore masks the next few months, by his own experts in the CDC and other agencies, if we wore this mask the next few months, we’d save 100,000 lives",Joe Biden
" 100,000",Joe Biden
"It’s estimated we lost over 135,000 lives so far needlessly because he’s done virtually nothing",Joe Biden
 But still Donald Trump refuses to listen to science,Joe Biden
 We shouldn’t be politicizing this race for a vaccine,Joe Biden
" We should be planning for its safe and equitable and free distribution when it comes, and it will",Joe Biden
" Providing for funding for PP, masks, gloves, all the things we need to set national standards for our schools and our businesses to open safely because they can",Joe Biden
" The House of Representatives already voted the money to provide for safe opening of these schools, but Trump was either locked in his sand trap in his golf course or in the bunker in the White House",Joe Biden
 He’s not brought anybody together,Joe Biden
Think about this all if you’re old enough,Joe Biden
 Can you think of any president where there’s been a national crisis who didn’t bring all the parties together in the White House to try to solve something? He’s done nothing,Joe Biden
 Nothing,Joe Biden
" Well, I’m going to bring Democrats and Republicans together to deliver the economic relief for families, schools, and businesses",Joe Biden
" I said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy",Joe Biden
 I’m not going to shut down the country,Joe Biden
 I’m going to shut down the virus,Joe Biden
"Look, Donald Trump crashed the economy that Barack and I left him",Joe Biden
" Like everything else he’s left and inherited, he squandered it",Joe Biden
 We can build back better with an economy that rewards work not wealth,Joe Biden
 We can do it without raising taxes on the middle class,Joe Biden
" I guarantee you, no matter what you hear this president lying about, no one making less than $400,000 a year will have one penny in taxes raised",Joe Biden
 Not one penny,Joe Biden
 It’s a guarantee,Joe Biden
 But we’re going to ask the wealthiest and the biggest corporations,Joe Biden
 91 of the top corporate companies in America paid zero federal income tax,Joe Biden
 We’re going to ask them to begin to pay their fair share,Joe Biden
 No one will pay at a higher rate than they paid at the beginning of the Bush administration,Joe Biden
" That’s who will deliver tax relief for working families, the middle class, to help them buy their first home, help them pay for their healthcare premiums or childcare or caring for an aging loved one",Joe Biden
"Trump got a Supreme Court Justice, and you know why he did it, it’s clear to everybody now, to destroy the Affordable Care Act, to take away the healthcare for 20 million Americans who have it",Joe Biden
" And over 100,000, 100,000 who are covered because they have pre-existing conditions for the first time, including 340,000 Georgians",Joe Biden
" A hundred million Americans would lose their protections for preexisting conditions, including more than 4 million here in the State of Georgia",Joe Biden
"Complications from COVID-19 are going to become the next pre-existing condition because of heart scarring, lung scarring, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, deny coverage and women will once again be able to be charged more for their healthcare just because they’re women",Joe Biden
 Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege,Joe Biden
 I think it’s an American right,Joe Biden
" Look, if we all get out and vote, you’ll not only restore Obamacare, but we’ll strengthen it and build on it so you can keep your private insurance or choose a Medicare-like public option",Joe Biden
" We’ll increase subsidies and lower your premiums and deductions, out of pocket spending, reduce prescription costs by 60%",Joe Biden
" that’s to the experts are telling me, and they’ll tell you",Joe Biden
 We’re going to make sure we keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions,Joe Biden
"And by the way, I’ll protect Social Security and Medicare",Joe Biden
" Meanwhile, Donald Trump says if he’s reelected, he’s going to change how we fund it",Joe Biden
" Ladies and gentlemen, the actuary at Social Security said if he does what he’s proposing, if he’s reelected, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023",Joe Biden
" Go home and tell your parents who work like hell for that, what that’s coming up",Joe Biden
Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy,Joe Biden
 He doesn’t believe there’s systemic racism as a problem,Joe Biden
 And he won’t say Black Lives Matter because they do,Joe Biden
 We know they matter,Joe Biden
 That’s why a season of protests broken out all across the nation,Joe Biden
" Protesting though, is not burning and looting",Joe Biden
 Violence can never be a tactic or tolerated and it won’t,Joe Biden
 But much of it is a cry for justice from a community that long had the knees of injustice on their necks,Joe Biden
" The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, will not soon be forgotten",Joe Biden
" Not by me, not by us, not by this country",Joe Biden
" Folks, they’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America",Joe Biden
 But true justice is also about jobs,Joe Biden
 Good paying jobs,Joe Biden
" The least as the mayor got done here, a $15 minimum wage and financial stability",Joe Biden
 We’re going to pass a national $15 an hour minimum wage,Joe Biden
Nobody should have to work two jobs to be above the poverty level,Joe Biden
 It’s wrong,Joe Biden
 We’re going to change it,Joe Biden
" And by the way, when we do it, what all the experts will tell you, even the Wall Street types, we’re going to raise the economy, raise the standard of living for everybody",Joe Biden
" When folks at the bottom do better, everybody does better all the way up the ladder",Joe Biden
"We’re going to give black and minority families are real shot to own a home, start a small business, send a child to college debt free so they can build wealth and pass on opportunity through the generations like everybody else who’s moved to the middle class has been able to do",Joe Biden
" We’re going to invest $70 billion in our HBCUs and minority serving institutions so students like Maya studied at Howard or students at Morehouse, Spelman, Clark Atlanta University",Joe Biden
 The future generations of proud students continue to get the very best education,Joe Biden
" And by the way, in the White House, I’ve committed, there is going to be in the outreach community, a section of The Divine Nine will be included",Joe Biden
 That’s a promise,Joe Biden
I’ve been told that I kind of grew up with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder being an Irish Catholic kid in a town that kind of looked down on it,Joe Biden
" I tell you what, I didn’t realize I do, but I realized I do have a chip on my shoulder",Joe Biden
" When I read from serious people about eight months ago, something about how if I were elected president, I’d be the first president who didn’t go to an Ivy league school in a long time",Joe Biden
 Like somehow it meant I didn’t belong,Joe Biden
 I know Senator Harris will be the first HBCU graduate to serve as vice president,Joe Biden
 And I say it’s about time a graduate from a state university and a HBCU graduate are in the White House,Joe Biden
" Don’t tell me we can’t do it because if we’re sitting there, you will be there, too",Joe Biden
 I promise you,Joe Biden
"Folks, I’m optimistic because I know that we can meet the challenge of the climate crisis by unleashing American ingenuity and manufacturing to create millions of new high paying jobs, investing in technology and research",Joe Biden
" Folks, this is all in our capacity",Joe Biden
 We can do this,Joe Biden
There aren’t a lot of pundits who would’ve guessed four years ago that a Democratic candidate for president of 2020 would be campaigning in Georgia on the final week of the election,Joe Biden
" Or that we’d have such competitive Senate races in Georgia, but we do because something’s happening here in Georgia and across America",Joe Biden
" People of different races, backgrounds, Democrats, Republicans, independents, they’re coming together to transcend the old divides and show it’s possible",Joe Biden
 And this is the most important election in any of your lifetimes,Joe Biden
" It’s a battle, as I said at the outset, for the soul of America, and we’re showing who we are",Joe Biden
" You and I, Reverend Warnock, Jon Ossoff, all of us",Joe Biden
 This country can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell,Joe Biden
 They can’t afford four more years of leaders who think they’re only responsible for people who vote for them,Joe Biden
"Folks, I don’t see America that way",Joe Biden
 This has to change,Joe Biden
 It will change with me,Joe Biden
" Every American, including the guys on the other side of the fence, will be seen and heard and respected by me",Joe Biden
" If elected president, there will be no red states or blue states, there’ll only be the United States of America",Joe Biden
 I was reminded of that earlier this month when I went to the sacred grounds of Gettysburg,Joe Biden
 Abraham Lincoln taught us about the need of united nation,Joe Biden
" I was reminded of that earlier today when I was up in Warm Springs, reflecting on Franklin Roosevelt, taught us about the need to heal our nation",Joe Biden
" Folks, I’m running as a proud Democrat but I’ll govern as an American president to unite and to heal",Joe Biden
"I promise you, look at my whole career",Joe Biden
 I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do,Joe Biden
 That’s the job of a president,Joe Biden
 A duty to care for everyone,Joe Biden
" So in these final days, stay empowered, stay optimistic, stay united because you too have a sacred duty",Joe Biden
 The duty to vote,Joe Biden
 It matters,Joe Biden
" Georgia, it matters",Joe Biden
" So, please vote",Joe Biden
 Help get out the vote,Joe Biden
 Early in-person voting in Georgia goes through October 30th,Joe Biden
" If you’re voting by mail, return your ballot as soon as possible and make sure everyone you know does the same",Joe Biden
" Don’t just take yourself to the polls, bring your brother, your sister, your mom, your dad, your neighbor, your friends",Joe Biden
 Drop your ballot off in a ballot box,Joe Biden

"” He went on to say, “You must use it",Joe Biden
 It’s not guaranteed,Joe Biden
 You can lose it,Joe Biden
” Use it,Joe Biden
 You have the power to win this election,Joe Biden
 There’s nothing beyond our capacity,Joe Biden
 There’s no limit on America’s future,Joe Biden
 The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself,Joe Biden
 No other nation can do it,Joe Biden
 Only America can tear America apart,Joe Biden
 Everybody knows who Donald Trump is,Joe Biden
 Let’s show them who we are,Joe Biden
" We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction, and yes, truth over lies",Joe Biden
" So folks, it’s time to stand up and take back our democracy and any place, we can do it here in Georgia",Joe Biden
" We win Georgia, we win everything",Joe Biden
 God bless you all and may God protect our troops,Joe Biden
